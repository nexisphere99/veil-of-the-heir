<<speech "thalara">>Your hand is a story, Caelan. It tells of battles won and losses mourned. But now it will also tell of patience, finesse, and choice.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I can feel the difference. It‚Äôs like every movement is more deliberate, more‚Ä¶ thoughtful. But sometimes, it feels unfamiliar. Almost foreign.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>That unfamiliarity is the soil where new strength grows. Strength not forged in fire, but nurtured in calm. Elegance is its own kind of power.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Exactly so. Velvet protects the steel, but it also invites touch. It does not demand respect through force, but through allure. There is a deep courage in that.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I suppose I‚Äôm learning a new language one spoken in gestures and glances, not shouts and clangs.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>And you will speak it fluently, in time. The world listens closely to those who wield grace. They bend not by weakness, but by wisdom.<</speech>><br>
