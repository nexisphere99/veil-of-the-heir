<<speech "mc">>It feels like I‚Äôm smiling even when I‚Äôm not. These lips‚Ä¶ this skin‚Ä¶<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Porcelain smooth. Not made for war, but for rule. That‚Äôs a different kind of strength.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>She is you. Fully, finally. And beautifully so.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I didn‚Äôt come here to be beautiful. I came to be me. And I‚Äôm still figuring out who that is.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>That‚Äôs honest. And rare. This elixir won‚Äôt return you to the battlefield, nor to the boy who stood at its edge. But it will bring balance if that‚Äôs what you truly want.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>What will change?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>The cheeks will ease. The chin will settle stronger. The lips less sculpted, more real. You‚Äôll still carry her grace, but not her ideal.<</speech>><br>
