<<speech "mc">>‚Ä¶It feels like stepping back after progress.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Transformation is not always a straight path forward. Sometimes we must retreat to better understand the strength in simpler forms.

<<speech "mc">>Will I lose the balance and beauty I gained?<</speech>><br>

Balance remains, though more refined. Beauty is not only in depth but in subtlety. This step softens your leg without sacrificing its grace.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>The warmth in my leg is fading already.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
That signals the magic reshaping your flesh. The pronounced curves will ease, the skin‚Äôs texture will lighten   a delicate shift back to gentler contours.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Expect a taste like sweet herbs with a faint trace of wildflowers   gentle yet potent.

<<speech "mc">>How soon will I feel the difference?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Within the hour, the curves will soften and your leg will carry itself with a lighter touch. Movements will become more fluid but less pronounced.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>If I resist this, what then?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Resistance will delay the change and make it more uncomfortable. Let the magic flow freely   it serves your body‚Äôs harmony.
<</speech>><br>

Every transformation, forward or back, teaches us something about ourselves. Embrace it, and you will find strength even in softness.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I hope I can move with this new form gracefully.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
You will. Drink the potion, and your leg will begin to bloom into gentler grace once more.

Step forward, Caelan. This last potion is unlike any before   it will perfect your leg‚Äôs transformation, weaving strength and elegance into a single, flowing form.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>It feels like the end of a long path... but also like a new beginning.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Precisely. Transformation is both an ending and a dawn. Your right leg will now carry the full grace and poise expected of a queen.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Yes. The magic sharpens your senses, harmonizing muscle and bone with a dancer‚Äôs precision. Every step will feel natural, balanced, and fluid.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>What about the strength? Will it be lost entirely?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Not lost, refined. Femininity is strength in a different form   subtle, enduring, and graceful. Your leg will support you with quiet power, not blunt force.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I can feel it already   warmth, lightness, and... something like pride.<</speech>><br>

Good. That pride is yours to claim   the pride of becoming who you are meant to be. The curves, the softness, the grace   they are all part of your new strength.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>This change... it feels almost like magic itself has rewritten my body‚Äôs story.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Magic is the language of change, Caelan. Your body is a story written in flesh and bone, and now it tells a tale of transformation and power intertwined.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>What happens after this session? Will I need to relearn how to move?<</speech>><br>

You will. But relearning is growth. Your body will guide you, teaching new rhythms and balances   a dance of strength and femininity.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I am ready to embrace this final step, no matter what it means.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Then drink, and let the last threads of transformation weave their perfect pattern into your form. Your journey to becoming queen continues, stronger and more beautiful than ever.

Step forward, Caelan. This potion will gently undo the last touches of your leg‚Äôs femininity   softening and restoring balance where once there was pronounced elegance.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>It feels like letting go of something precious... but maybe it‚Äôs necessary.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Transformation is never just gaining. Sometimes it requires release   a reshaping, a return to steadiness.

Not lost, shifted. The power of subtlety replaces the flair of refined elegance. Your leg will carry strength in a quieter, steadier form.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I can already feel the curves softening, the sharpness fading.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Yes. The magic is easing your muscles and bones back toward a moderate shape   less striking, but no less vital.

<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>Will my movements change much after this?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
You will move with a steadier rhythm. The dance of grace will become simpler, grounded   like walking on firm earth after floating on air.
