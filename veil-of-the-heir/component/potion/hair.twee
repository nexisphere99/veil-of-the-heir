<<nobr>>
<br>
<<speech "thalara">>Choice is a curious thing, Your Highness. Some find it in rebellion, others in surrender. But even indecision... is a choice in disguise.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>You speak in riddles, Thalara. Do you ever say anything plainly?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Rarely. Plain words carry heavy truths, and most prefer a little mystery in their medicine.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Hair is trivial to most. A vanity. A fashion. But for those born to rule in Velmoria, it is part of the rite. Our ancestors believed that a ruler‚Äôs hair must mirror her heart growing wild only when she accepts herself.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>And if I never accept myself like that? If I don‚Äôt want to grow into the queen they all expect?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Then you may never grow hair beyond your collar‚Ä¶ or perhaps you‚Äôll grow it and still feel like a stranger inside your own skin. But that is not failure, dear prince. That is simply a different path.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>This potion will awaken the follicles that once lay dormant. It is slow, respectful magic. The body must learn it is safe to change.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>It tingles already. Like‚Ä¶ like my head is remembering something it forgot.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Good. That‚Äôs the potion greeting your nerves. The mind resists faster than the flesh, but flesh has patience. You may fight it, mourn it, or lean into it. All of those reactions are sacred.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>Is it wrong that I feel‚Ä¶ nervous?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>No. It would be stranger if you felt nothing. But nerves are not enemies. They are just truth in motion.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Look. Only wisps now, but they are yours. The first strand, born of your decision however it was made.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>Will the rest be like this? Gentle and slow?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I don‚Äôt want the world whispering about me. Not like this.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Then let it whisper. And you‚Ä¶ you may choose whether to listen or ignore it. That too is power.<</speech>><br>

[[Move Forth|hair_2_hair_3_2]]
<</nobr>>

:: hair_2_hair_3_2
<<nobr>>

<<speech "thalara">>Because it is. Hair has memory. Not just of genetics, but of intent. Each time I touch your crown, it listens. It remembers your resistance. Your surrender. Your curiosity.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>What if I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm feeling anymore? Some days I wake up and want this. Others I feel like I‚Äôm erasing myself.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>You are not erasing. You are shedding. There's a difference. The serpent does not mourn its old skin. The tree does not grieve last season‚Äôs leaves. And yet both continue wiser, changed, alive.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>You make it sound beautiful. But it doesn‚Äôt always feel that way. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm pretending. Like I‚Äôm performing softness, but I still ache inside.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>And yet here you are sitting before me, letting the strands grow. Even pretending is a kind of bravery. Sometimes we walk into roles before we grow into them.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>That sounds like manipulation.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>No. It is hope. I am not twisting you. I am showing you the mirror and asking, 'What might you become if you stepped closer?'<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>Do you think I‚Äôll ever feel... like her? Like a real woman, not just a made one?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Mmm. In the old kingdoms, it was a sign of spiritual readiness of leaving behind the boy's sword and taking up the queen‚Äôs mantle. To let one‚Äôs hair touch the back was to welcome intuition over instinct. Wisdom over conquest.<</speech>><br>
