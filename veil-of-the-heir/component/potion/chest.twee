<<speech "thalara">>Good. That means it‚Äôs working. The swelling in your chest will ease first. That defined line under your collarbone it‚Äôll blur. Pectorals will yield to smoother flesh. Your heart will beat more openly, less behind armor.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>It must be. What lies ahead is not subtle, Caelan. This draught will reshape your presence. Not just your body but how the world receives it.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I‚Äôve been knocking things off shelves just by turning. And now you‚Äôre saying they‚Äôll get bigger?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Not merely bigger. Commanding. They will sway with every step, pull at your spine, and demand garments made to bear their weight. You will feel them in every movement.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>So I‚Äôll need straps. Lots of straps.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Straps... and strength. Not the strength of swords or shields, but of poise. Balance. The kind of strength queens must learn when their very presence becomes spectacle.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I didn‚Äôt think boobs would ever feel like power. But this? This is getting hard to ignore.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>That‚Äôs the point. Level Seven is not for hiding. It‚Äôs for owning. You are becoming a woman that the world will turn its head for whether you like it or not.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>So you seek form again. There‚Äôs no shame in that. Becoming a queen isn‚Äôt a straight line. It‚Äôs a spiral. Sometimes we walk it backward.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>Will this make me masculine again?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Not fully. This draught brings back tone, not dominance. It sharpens what was dulled. It whispers strength doesn‚Äôt shout it.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>Why does it feel like a guilty sip?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Because we‚Äôre trained to think undoing is failure. But it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs remembering. Testing. Feeling the old skin again to see if it still fits.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>‚Ä¶It‚Äôs hot. Almost peppery.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Fireroot and ironleaf. Masculine herbs. They fuel will, not just muscle.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>It‚Äôs not what it was‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs something again.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Not prince, not queen. But anchored again. Re-shaped, not erased.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I don‚Äôt know what I want to be. But I think I need to feel‚Ä¶ real. Defined. Even if it‚Äôs temporary.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Then this session has done its work. You are not a prisoner of either path, Caelan. You are a walker between them.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>Thank you‚Ä¶ for not shaming me.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>This chamber does not demand shame. Only honesty. Come back when you‚Äôre ready for the next step forward or back.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>The brew is ready. Fireroot for your blood, ironroot for your bones. It will rebuild what you softened last time.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>Will it hurt?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>No. But it will burn. The kind of burn you feel when your breath hits the cold air after a run. It‚Äôs not pain it‚Äôs memory.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>More or less. The edge will return angles beneath the skin, the firmness of muscle rebuilt. Your chest will square again. And with it, your presence. Bold. Clear.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>It‚Äôs strange. I thought I wanted to move forward. But something about seeing myself fade like that‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt ready.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>That‚Äôs not weakness. It‚Äôs awareness. The transformation you‚Äôre undertaking isn‚Äôt a straight road. There are turns, retreats, and resting points. And there is power in saying no.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>The potion will draw the strength from deep within you not from muscle alone, but from memory. From your boyhood games, the swordplay in the training yards, the day you first bested your father in a match.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>And now it spreads. Your blood carries it into the fibers of your chest. Look already, the shape is shifting.<</speech>><br>
