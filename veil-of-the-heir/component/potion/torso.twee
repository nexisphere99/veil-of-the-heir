<<speech "thalara">>Welcome, Caelan. I see you‚Äôve made your decision. However difficult, however noble or simply inevitable. This is the first of many transformations‚Ä¶ and it begins not with grand spectacle, but with subtle change.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>...So this is it. My body starts turning into something else. Into someone else.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>No, not someone else. Into yourself, reimagined. You may feel disoriented, even betrayed by your own skin. But transformation is not loss it is refinement. The steel remains... we merely reshape the blade.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I still feel like this body is part of who I am. The strength, the width of my shoulders I've trained with Sir Aldric since I was a boy. This doesn‚Äôt just vanish.<</speech>><br>

[[Move Forth|torso_ml_torso_mm_2]]

:: torso_ml_torso_mm_2
<<nobr>>

<<speech "thalara">>And it shouldn‚Äôt. But strength has many forms, my prince. Some visible, some not. What you‚Äôve learned in battle will live in your spine, in your balance. Even as your shape softens, your core your discipline remains. This potion doesn‚Äôt erase you; it invites the rest of you forward.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>And yet, my waist will shrink, my bones realign, and I‚Äôll lose the body I‚Äôve known since childhood.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Yes. The potion guides your form into a silhouette that suits the queen you are becoming. Narrower flanks, a taper of the torso, a gentler rise at the chest. The beginning of space for gowns and corsets, for gestures to flow rather than clash.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>Sounds like I‚Äôm being molded into a dress form.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Perhaps. Or perhaps into a vessel of power in a world that kneels before beauty, grace, and presence. Remember, in Velmoria, the queen‚Äôs body is not just adorned it commands attention, redirects courtly currents, holds the eye of friend and rival alike.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>And this potion how does it actually work? I thought transformation was violent. This sounds‚Ä¶ poetic.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Most physical changes occur beneath the surface first. This first draft targets the subdermal tissue, loosening muscle memory, guiding the growth plates of the ribs inward. Your abdomen will become more supple, while the dorsal spine will slowly arch to allow for a regal posture. Your internal balance will shift. It is not instant it will take days but the shift begins the moment the potion touches your tongue.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>And it won‚Äôt hurt?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Not in the way a blade hurts. You may feel warmth then pressure. A pulling sensation at your waist. Your breath may catch as your diaphragm realigns. Some describe it as... being unwound and re-knotted with silken thread.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>‚Ä¶Do you remember everyone you‚Äôve done this to?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Yes. Every one of them. Some wept. Some laughed. One threw the vial at my head. But in time, they each saw their reflection change and saw strength where they feared loss. And not all ended the same. Some embraced womanhood. Others found balance. A few‚Ä¶ resisted until the very end. You will write your own path through this.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>You lie back on the velvet table. I will cast a stabilizing ward to guide the changes. You may feel dizzy or flushed. By the next morning, you will begin to notice the way your tunic hangs differently. Your waistline will inch inward. Breathing may feel lighter or stranger. That will be the first sign.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I suppose there‚Äôs no turning back?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>This potion moves only forward. But you, Caelan‚Ä¶ you have choices. You can slow the process. You can guide its direction. And more than anything you can define what womanhood means to you. Drink when you‚Äôre ready.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>This draft is different. Reversal is heavier magic blunt, raw, and less graceful. It strengthens bone density, reverses the contractions of the waistline, and re-engages your abdominal wall. You‚Äôll feel your frame stretch outward, your breath deepen, your center re-anchor.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>That‚Äôs what I need. To feel anchored again. To feel like I‚Äôm not shrinking.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>But know this: the magic does not forget. It will resist being unwoven. There may be pain spasms in your lower spine, tightness in the ribs as they flare outward. And the more you transform back and forth, the harder it becomes to remain whole. Your body will carry echoes of each shape.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>So this is my last clear fork in the road?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Yes. If you drink this, it won‚Äôt close the path forward entirely, but it will make every future step slower... heavier. The body will grow stubborn. It will begin to choose sides for you.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>I‚Äôve felt off-balance since I began changing. As if my reflection belongs to someone I don‚Äôt recognize. This whatever the cost will let me feel like myself again.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>You may always stop. I will never bind your will. But transformation is not just magic, Caelan. It is motion. And motion builds momentum.

<<speech "thalara">>You‚Äôve returned for the final shaping. This time, the potion knows no hesitation. It will curve what‚Äôs straight, soften what‚Äôs square, and ready your frame for the mantle of royalty.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>It‚Äôs hard to believe this is still my body. Every sip pulls me further from the battlefield and closer to‚Ä¶ the ballroom.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>And why should the ballroom be lesser? Power is not always clenched in fists, Caelan. Sometimes it is wielded from a throne, with gloved hands and veiled smiles.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>But this body was once armor. Now you make it into‚Ä¶ a gown rack.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Not just a rack for silks and stays. A symbol. A declaration. This final form Feminine Level Three is not weakness. It‚Äôs a banner. It says, 'I am not a prince hiding in silk I am a queen claiming it.'<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>What exactly will it change?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>Your ribcage will narrow further. The waist will cinch in, almost naturally corset-shaped. The line from your shoulder to hip will slope in the manner tailors adore. You‚Äôll be ready to wear gowns that whisper of station and seduction, without a word spoken.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>And once it‚Äôs done‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no mistaking it, is there?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>Is that what my mother saw when she made this pact with you?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>She saw your strength and wanted to teach you how to use it in every form. She believes in a ruler who understands both sword and scepter, steel and satin.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ warm. Tight. My ribs feel like they‚Äôre being drawn together with string.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>That‚Äôs the bone alignment shifting. Your waistline narrows naturally now. It‚Äôs not a trick of lacing or illusion this is the shape your body was always ready to hold.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>It‚Äôs beautiful. Strange. I used to dread this moment‚Ä¶ but now I just feel full. Full of something new.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>You are regal now, in body and bearing. No more halfway. No more waiting. You are corset-ready not because it binds you, but because it frames you.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>It‚Äôs strange. I thought once I crossed that line once I became her there‚Äôd be no going back.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>That‚Äôs the myth, isn‚Äôt it? That transformation is a one-way street. But no magic I wield is about prisons. It‚Äôs about choice.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>So this‚Ä¶ will unlace me?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>It will ease you back to something softer. Still feminine. Still shaped. But not carved like a statue. You‚Äôll move with curve, not edge.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>And it won‚Äôt erase everything?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>No. You‚Äôll still hold the grace. Just less of the posture, less of the narrow cinch that made every breath feel rehearsed.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>My waist is still curved, but‚Ä¶ it looks more natural. Less drawn. I don‚Äôt feel as‚Ä¶ poised, but I feel more real.<</speech>><br>
