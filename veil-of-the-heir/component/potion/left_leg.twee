Step forward, Caelan. The first transformation is never about the body   it is about your relationship with what you think it means.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>
‚Ä¶Right.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
This draught won‚Äôt sculpt breasts or enchant curves. Not yet. All it will do is ask your chest to let go, to ease its grip on a shape that has served you until now.
<</speech>><br>

No. But it will unfasten the pride your muscles have worn like armor. Not every kind of strength shows in bulk. Sometimes, strength shows in surrender.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>
You sound like a philosopher.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
When you‚Äôve brewed potions that change bones and bend voices, you learn to respect the philosophy of flesh.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
This will taste like mint, metal, and maybe‚Ä¶ regret. You may feel your chest ache for its former form. That‚Äôs normal. Muscles remember.

How fast will it work?
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Gradually. Within the hour, the tautness in your chest will soften. Your posture will shift. Clothes will feel looser. And you may‚Ä¶ feel exposed.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>
You mean‚Ä¶ like I‚Äôm losing something?
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
You are. But you‚Äôre not being robbed. You are offering it, in exchange for something else. That‚Äôs what every step in magic is   a trade, not a theft.

‚Ä¶It‚Äôs cold.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Good. That means it‚Äôs working. The swelling in your chest will ease first. That defined line under your collarbone   it‚Äôll blur. Pectorals will yield to smoother flesh. Your heart will beat more openly, less behind armor.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>
‚Ä¶It feels strange already. Like I‚Äôve been‚Ä¶ unmade a little.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
That‚Äôs the beginning, Caelan. Unmaking to remake. You‚Äôre shedding the rigid frame of the past to shape the future queen. You will have moments of doubt   moments when you want to reach back. That‚Äôs human.

Step forward, Caelan. This dose will ease your left leg away from its fullest feminine grace. It is not loss, but a gentle return toward balance and strength.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>
This... feels like retreating. Will I lose the poise I‚Äôve gained?
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Poise will remain, though reshaped. Your leg will carry a sturdier elegance ‚Äî strength softened, but not surrendered.
<</speech>><br>

You are not less, Caelan. You are stepping into a form that honors both your power and your grace, just in different measure.
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>
Will it hurt? Will the magic pull and stretch my flesh back?
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
There may be warmth and a slight tension as your flesh and bone reconfigure. It is transformation‚Äôs ebb ‚Äî the unweaving of enchantment with care.

<</speech>><br>

<<speech "mc">>
And if I resist going backward?
<</speech>><br>

<<speech "thalara">>
Resistance only prolongs tension. Acceptance allows your body to find harmony again in this gentler form.
