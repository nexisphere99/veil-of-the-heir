The torches flickered along the arena's high walls, casting sharp slashes of gold across the arena’s blood dampened sand. I stood barefoot in the center, chained by thick iron cuffs that clung tight to my wrists, the links slack enough to allow me some motion but tight enough to remind me I was not here of my own volition.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_1/2.png">><</passage_img>>

I was shirtless, sweat sheening my chest, the weight of hundreds of watching eyes prickling over my skin like cold rain. The crowd above me murmured in a language I didn’t understand, sharp consonants punctuated by hungry moans and cheers.This wasn’t just sport. It was spectacle. Ritual. Or worse initiation. The iron gate before me groaned open, screeching on rusted hinges.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_1/3.png">><</passage_img>>

A woman stepped out first. She was towering easily a head taller than me, muscles rippling beneath oiled bronze skin. Her leather armor clung to her like a second skin, studded with metal and cut low enough that the swell of her breasts defied restraint, dark nipples outlined through tight suede. Her thighs were like tree trunks, scarred from battle, her long dark hair braided into a whip thick rope slung over one shoulder. She strode forward with the slow, menacing confidence of a predator.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_1/4.png">><</passage_img>>

Behind her came the second.Even taller. Bare skinned. Golden circlet glittering on her brow. Her cock gods help me swayed between her thighs with each step, fat and semi hard already, pierced through the head with a tiny loop of silver. Her breasts were high and firm, hips rolling wide and slow as if the world had no reason to move faster than her pace.

<span style="color: green;"><strong>Caelan thah! Caelan thah!</strong></span>

The futa queen stopped just before me and tilted her head.

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“He’s pretty.”</strong></span>

<span style="color: blue;"><strong>“Very pretty. Let’s see if the little prince fights.”</strong></span>

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“I doubt he will. They never do in dreams.”</strong></span>

I flinched.Wait what?. But there was no time to think. The Futa was already behind me, one massive hand closing around the chain at my back, pulling it taut so my arms were drawn up. Her other hand slapped my ass through my trousers hard, sharp, shocking.

<strong style="color: purple;">“AH !”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;"><strong>“Good. He makes noise.”</strong></span>

The futa queen leaned in and kissed me just like that. No warning. Her lips were hot and tasting of honeyed wine. Her tongue forced mine open, and I groaned, unable to do anything but respond. She pulled back slowly, letting our breath mingle.

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“I’m going to fuck you, little prince. Right here in front of the gods and your ancestors.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“W what?”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;"><strong>“Beg for it.”</strong></span>

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Let’s make him.”</strong></span> 

The futa queen whispered, snapping her fingers. Magic shimmered through the sand. My trousers melted into ash.

<span style="color: blue;"><strong>“Look at him. He’s ready.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“No, I’m ”</strong>

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Shhh. No more talking unless it’s moaning.”</strong></span>

Her mouth moved to my neck, tongue tracing the line of my pulse. I shivered. The Futa stepped around to kneel before me, lifting my cock with rough fingers.

<span style="color: blue;"><strong>“Look at this. Such a sweet little thing. Think he’ll cry when I suck it?”</strong></span>

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“I hope so.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Oh oh fuck ! Gods stop ”</strong>

But they didn’t. She sucked me with rhythmic determination, spit leaking from her lips, moaning as if my cock fed her hunger.  The futa queen held my chin, watching my face contort with ecstasy.

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Let go. Give it to her. Come.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I I can’t !”</strong>

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“You will.”</strong></span>

The Futa’s throat swallowed me down, and my body betrayed me.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Aaaah nnnnghh f fuck !”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;"><strong>“Delicious.”</strong></span>

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“I want him now. Get on your knees, prince.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I what are you ?”</strong>

She slapped me.

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Knees.”</strong></span>

I dropped. Her cock bobbed inches from my face now.

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Open.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I…”</strong>

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Open.”</strong></span>

She slid inside slowly.

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“That’s it… gods, your mouth’s perfect.”</strong></span>

The Futa stroked my hair.

<span style="color: blue;"><strong>“You’re doing so well. Such a good little mouth.”</strong></span>

Then she pulled out.

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“On your back.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Wh what ?”</strong>

The Futa tackled me to the sand.

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“You’re going to dream of this cock for the rest of your life.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I don’t !”</strong>

She pushed inside.

<strong style="color: purple;">“UHHnnnnghhhhh G GODS!”</strong>

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Fuck, you’re tight.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“You’re breaking me !”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;"><strong>“Good. Break.”</strong></span>

The futa futa queen began to fuck me. The Futa knelt beside us, fingers pinching my nipples.

<strong style="color: purple;">“AHhh gods nghhh stop, I’m !”</strong>

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Coming? Already?”</strong></span>

My cock was rock hard again.

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Come, then. Spray your seed while I ruin your ass.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">MMMmmmmmm ahhhhh....</strong>

She kept fucking me through it. Her own release came moments later.

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Uhhhhhhhhh fuck Take it. Take every drop.”</strong></span>

And the dream kept going. They flipped me. Took turns. They used me. Worshiped me. The final position me on all fours…

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Fuck, he’s clenching.”</strong></span>

<span style="color: blue;"><strong>“He loves this. He loves being fucked.”</strong></span>

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Say it.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I I love being f fucked! Fucked by strong w women !”</strong>

They came again. So did I. Again. And again. And then I woke up. My sheets were soaked. My cock, half hard, twitched once more before going still. My body ached in ways that didn’t make sense. My breath came in pants. My thighs were damp with something that shouldn’t have been possible. But it had happened. A dream. But not just any dream. A warning? A prophecy? Or worse… a desire?

:: dream_2

<<passage_img "dream/dream_2/1.png">><</passage_img>>

They called it a coronation, but the hall reeked of sex and sweat. I sat at the head of the Queen’s grand table, wearing a diaphanous tunic of pale lavender silk, sleeveless and cut scandalously high. My chest was smooth now breasts barely budding beneath the fabric, pert and tender to the touch. My waist had cinched subtly, hips swelling with a softness that hadn’t existed last season. I still had my cock but it had changed, too. Smaller now. Slender. More sensitive than I’d ever imagined.

The feast stretched before me in glistening splendor. Tables groaned under the weight of roasted boar, honey glazed figs, sugared petals. Velvet banners hung above, bearing my name: "QUEEN CAELAN".

<<passage_img "dream/dream_2/2.png">><</passage_img>>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Not yet,”</strong> I whispered to myself. <strong style="color: purple;">“I’m not queen yet.”</strong>

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Not with that voice, you’re not,”</strong></span> purred a familiar tone beside me.

Mistress Veletia, the royal clothier, leaned down from behind, her perfumed breath brushing my cheek. Her hands soft, long fingered, forever adjusting things rested lightly on my shoulders.

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Try again, my sweet,”</strong></span> she cooed. <span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Say it with pride.”</strong></span>

I swallowed. My throat felt tighter these days, or maybe just my shame.

<strong style="color: purple;">“I… am Queen Caelan.”</strong> I said, voice cracking.

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Closer.”</strong></span>

Across the table, nobles clinked goblets and laughed, but the noise blurred, distanced, like echoes from another dream. My focus narrowed.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_2/3.png">><</passage_img>>

A woman approached the table no, glided. Robes of deep emerald silk whispered over the stone floor, embroidered with golden vines. Her hair, midnight black, fell in layered waves down her back. A jeweled circlet rested on her brow, and beneath the slit of her robe swayed something unmistakable.

She was beautiful in the way goddesses are terrifying.

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Lady Seravelle of Alryne,”</strong></span> Veletia whispered with a purr. <span style="color:  red;"><strong>“And look… she’s brought her appetite.”</strong></span>

Seravelle stopped beside me, eyes roaming lazily over my form. She said nothing just leaned in, took my goblet, and sipped from it, her lips touching the same rim as mine had moments before. Then she set it down and licked her lips.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“You’re prettier than I expected,”</strong></span> she said at last, voice a smooth soprano with a hint of mockery. <span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“But then, I do enjoy unfinished things.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Unfinished?”</strong> I asked, my thighs suddenly pressed tight together beneath the table.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Oh, you’re a painting still in progress,”</strong></span> she said, walking behind me. <span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Look at these arms slender but not yet graceful. These cheeks flushed like a maiden but not quite rounded. That adorable cock…”</strong></span> she drew the word out like honey, <span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“...still clinging to relevance. So conflicted. So… ripe.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Lady Seravelle ”</strong>

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Hush,”</strong></span> Veletia interrupted, pressing a finger to my lips. <span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Let her look. You want to be admired, don’t you?”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I… I don’t know.”</strong>

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Then let us help you decide.”</strong></span>

Hands slid under the table. I gasped. Veletia on the left. Seravelle on the right. Both kneeling now, hidden by the long embroidered tablecloth that hung to the floor. Their hands brushed my thighs simultaneously warm, slow, exploratory. Veletia’s fingers, delicate and precise, traced lazy circles toward my inner thigh, while Seravelle’s touch was bolder calloused, possessive.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Let’s see what we’re working with,”</strong></span> Seravelle whispered from below, lifting my tunic.

The cool air licked across my exposed groin. My cock small now, barely the size of my middle finger twitched in sudden vulnerability. Beside it, my balls had tightened, drawn closer to my opening slit that hadn’t fully formed but throbbed like a promise beneath the skin.

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Precious,”</strong></span> Veletia whispered, planting a kiss on my lower abdomen. <span style="color:  red;"><strong>“You’ve grown so sensitive, haven’t you?”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“What… what are you ”</strong>

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Shhh.”</strong></span> Her tongue pressed against my length, flat and hot, dragging upward. I moaned, hips bucking.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Delicious,”</strong></span> she murmured, licking her lips. <span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“So eager for a thing so small.”</strong></span>

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Let me taste,”</strong></span> Veletia said. And then they were kissing mouths meeting over my cock, tongues swirling, trading saliva and groans.

I lost my breath.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Oh gods…”</strong>

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Such language,”</strong></span> Veletia chuckled. <span style="color:  red;"><strong>“You’ll have to work on that.”</strong></span>

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“He’s leaking,”</strong></span> Seravelle said, her voice thicker now. <span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Look at him twitch.”</strong></span>

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Stroke it,”</strong></span> Veletia whispered. <span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Use just your lips.”</strong></span>

Seravelle did. She sucked me in whole my entire cock disappearing into the heat of her mouth with a wet, obscene slurp. Veletia’s tongue danced below, lapping at my balls, teasing that half formed cleft with delicate precision.

<strong style="color: purple;">“AH ahh !”</strong>

I bit my lip, tried to still my hips, but their mouths held me prisoner. I could feel every inch of their tongues, the suction of Seravelle’s throat, the teasing flicks from Veletia. It was like drowning in silk and fire.

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“You’re going to come,”</strong></span> Veletia said sweetly. <span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Aren’t you?”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I I can’t !”</strong>

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“You will.”</strong></span> Her mouth still full of me.

Her hands gripped my hips. Her throat swallowed. I exploded. My body shook. My cock pulsed and spasmed inside her mouth, my vision flaring white. Seravelle swallowed every drop, eyes locked with mine the whole time. Then she pulled back, licking her lips.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“You come like a maiden.”</strong></span>

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“You tasted like roses and wine. So sweet. So… inexperienced.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I I don’t understand…”</strong>

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Of course not,”</strong></span> Veletia said, rising to her feet. <span style="color:  red;"><strong>“But your body does.”</strong></span>

<<passage_img "dream/dream_2/5.png">><</passage_img>>

Seravelle stood too, undoing the sash around her robe. The fabric parted. Her cock unfurled a monstrous thing, veined and dark, head glistening with fresh arousal. It curved slightly to the left, pierced near the crown with a silver stud. Below it, her pussy was wet and flushed, lips glistening and open. She saw my stare and laughed.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“I’m perfect, little prince,”</strong></span> she said. <span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“And tonight… so are you.”</strong></span>

She grabbed my chin, turned my face toward her.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Say it.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I…”</strong>

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Say you want me.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I I want you…”</strong>

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Say it like you mean it.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I want you, Lady Seravelle.”</strong>

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Take her. With your mouth. Show us that tongue.”</strong></span>

<<passage_img "dream/dream_2/6.png">><</passage_img>>

I dropped to my knees. Seravelle stepped forward, guiding her cock toward my lips. It was hot, heavy, the scent of her pussy thick in the air.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Open.”</strong></span>

I did. She slid in slowly, groaning as my lips wrapped around her.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Yessss… there’s my sweet little heir…”</strong></span>

Her cock filled my mouth inch by inch. I gagged, then steadied, tongue flattening beneath her. She rolled her hips, face serene, hands in my hair. Veletia reached around, cupping my budding breasts, teasing my nipples through the fabric.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Fuck he’s so tight,”</strong></span> Seravelle gasped. <span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“So eager.”</strong></span>

I moaned around her, my own cock twitching again. Veletia slid her hand down, slipped two fingers between my thighs, pressing where my new cleft had begun to swell.

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Wet already,”</strong></span> she whispered. <span style="color:  red;"><strong>“He’s soaking.”</strong></span>

Seravelle began to thrust. In. Out. Wet sounds filled the air, mingling with my muffled cries and the slap of Veletia’s palm against my ass.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“I want to fuck him,”</strong></span> Seravelle growled. <span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Flip him.”</strong></span>

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Yes, mistress.”</strong></span> Veletia purred.

I was lifted gently, but firmly laid across the banquet table itself. Plates were shoved aside. Fruit rolled to the floor. My tunic was bunched around my waist. My ass exposed. Veletia knelt beside me, spreading my cheeks.

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Still untouched,”</strong></span> she whispered.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Not for long.”</strong></span>

Seravelle spat into her hand, rubbed it along her shaft, then pressed her cock against my cleft.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Let me in, little queen…”</strong></span>

I gasped. She pushed forward. And entered. My entire body arched.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Oh fuck! g gods!”</strong>

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“Tight. Warm. You were made for this.”</strong></span>

Veletia held my hand, kissed my fingers.

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“Breathe, darling. Let her claim you.”</strong></span>

Seravelle began to thrust. Hard. Deep. The table creaked beneath us. I moaned into Veletia’s mouth as she kissed me, her tongue curling with mine. Seravelle fucked me like a thing she owned, her hands gripping my hips, her cock plunging deep again and again.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“You feel it?”</strong></span> she growled. <span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“My cock in your cunt?”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Y yes !”</strong>

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“You are a queen,”</strong></span> she hissed. <span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“You were born for this. To kneel. To spread. To serve.”</strong></span>

I cried out. My body convulsed. I came again. Unbidden. Unstoppable. My new folds gushed, muscles clenching around her cock, milking her. Veletia licked my tears.

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“You’re becoming, my sweet. Just let it happen.”</strong></span>

Seravelle howled. She came. Her cock pulsed inside me, filling me with hot, thick ropes. I felt it dripping from me before she even pulled out. And then Another noble approached. A man this time. Slender. Feminine. Dressed in velvet and pearls. When he opened his robe, he revealed a perfectly smooth cunt, wet and glistening.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_2/4.png">><</passage_img>>

<span style="color: teal;"><strong>“I want a turn,”</strong></span> he said.

And the dream blurred. Hands everywhere. Mouths. Cocks. Cunts. Heat and wetness. I was passed from lap to lap, each noble whispering their claim. Veletia made me straddle her face. Seravelle fed me her cock while the pearl clad noble rode my fingers.

<span style="color: orange;"><strong>“I want to ride him.”</strong></span>

<span style="color: teal;"><strong>“Let me use that tongue again.”</strong></span>

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“He moans like a slut, it’s divine.”</strong></span>

<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Stretch him wider. I want to feel my seed drip from his hole.”</strong></span>

I screamed. Came. Sobbed. Smiled. They used me. They worshiped me. They broke me. I had never been more whole. And then Silence. I sat on the throne. Legs parted. Naked. Filled. Veletia knelt before me, licking the last of Seravelle’s cum from my thighs.

<span style="color:  red;"><strong>“You are becoming, my Queen.”</strong></span>

Seravelle stood at my right, hand stroking her softening cock.

<span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“I will kneel for you again,”</strong></span> she said. <span style="color: darkgreen;"><strong>“When you’ve earned it.”</strong></span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Soon.”</strong>

:: dream_3
<<passage_img "dream/dream_3/1.png">><</passage_img>>

As moonlight shimmered through the veil of sacred branches, a hundred silver beams poured like ghostwater across the still pond of the garden shrine. The grove stood silent, womb like, cradled by the ring of ancient stone archways that curved overhead worn down by centuries of prayer, sex, and sacrifice.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_3/2.png">><</passage_img>>

I was naked, knees half sunk in soft mud at the pond’s edge, the surface rippling around my thighs. The water reached just above my hips. My breath fogged in the cool midnight air, but my skin flushed hot, electric, already tingling with some unreal anticipation. A bell chimed in the distance. Then again closer. A third time, behind me.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_3/3.png">><</passage_img>>

Two figures emerged from the mist. They walked barefoot and unhurried down the stone steps that led from the high altar, their white ceremonial robes barely concealing their bodies beneath the way a curtain can’t hide what it’s meant to highlight. Both of them towered over me, glowing with unearthly vitality. One had a goddess’s hips and a narrow waist, her long hair falling like waves of honey across golden shoulders. The other sharper, sleeker moved with the slow, predatory grace of a lioness who had already eaten and still hungered. And between their thighs swung thick, gorgeous cocks, semi hard already, heavy with the weight of use and purpose. They were priestesses of the fertility cult. And they had come for me.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_3/4.png">><</passage_img>>

<span style="color: red;">“Blessed Caelan,”</span> the curvier of the two intoned, her voice melodic, smoky. She stepped into the water without pause, wading toward me until her cock brushed my chest. <span style="color: red;">“You kneel before the holy pool of Tahlurei, goddess of seed and transformation.”</span>

I stared up at her, my breath hitching as her fingers slid through my damp hair.

<span style="color: blue;">“She hears your body,”</span> the other whispered, stepping behind me. <span style="color: blue;">“She feels your fear... and your yearning.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“My what?”</strong> I croaked. My voice trembled more than I expected. <strong style="color: purple;">“I didn’t  I didn’t say ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“You don’t have to,”</span> the second priestess said, pressing her palm flat between my shoulder blades. Her touch burned like a fever. <span style="color: blue;">“The goddess reads what you’re not brave enough to speak.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I… don’t know what I want.”</strong>

<span style="color: red;">“You will,”</span> the first murmured. Then she knelt, straddling my lap. Her cock lay heavy between us, pressing against my stomach soft, oozing pearls of translucent pre down the tight slope of my belly.

<strong style="color: purple;">“She’s eager,”</strong> I whispered.

<span style="color: red;">“She’s blessing you.”</span>

The priestess behind me lowered herself as well. I felt her breasts press against my back, her tongue begin to trace something across my skin a symbol? A rune? It felt more like language than touch. Her fingers dug into my hips, thumbs stroking just under the bones.

<strong style="color: purple;">“I’ve never ”</strong>

<span style="color: red;">“You have,”</span> said the one in front of me. <span style="color: red;">“In your dreams. In your thoughts. In the way you hesitate every time your hand finds your cock. You’ve always wanted someone to show you. You just never thought it would be us.”</span>

Her cock rubbed up under mine, pressing both between our bellies. My body, traitorous, flushed even hotter.

<strong style="color: purple;">“I shouldn’t want this,”</strong> I whispered.

<span style="color: red;">“Then why are you dripping, Caelan?”</span> she asked.

My breath caught. I looked down. She was right. My cock shrunken from what it once was throbbed and leaked in full betrayal, gleaming with arousal. Her shaft pulsed beside mine, veins thick, the head glistening and dark.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Please,”</strong> I murmured. I didn’t know what I was asking for. To stop. To begin. The priestess behind me reached forward, her arms encircling my chest. One hand gripped my left breast still barely there, but sensitive beyond belief. The other reached for my cock and closed around it, stroking. My knees gave out.

I sank lower into the water, gasping. She jacked me with slow, luxurious precision, her thumb flicking the tip as my own precum slicked her grip. The priestess in front leaned in and kissed me. Not gently. Not softly.

Her tongue forced its way into my mouth. Her hands slid down my sides, nails raking lightly across my waist. Then she gripped her cock and pressed it against my belly again, grinding.

<span style="color: red;">“You’ll lose this soon,”</span> she murmured into my lips. <span style="color: red;">“Your seed, your shape. The final change is coming.”</span>

She grabbed both our cocks now hers and mine held them together and stroked. Her hand squeezed around them, rubbing their shafts together, flesh against flesh.

<span style="color: red;">“You need to give it now. While you can. The goddess demands it.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I I can’t hold it…”</strong>

<span style="color: red;">“Then don’t.”</span>

She kissed me again. Her tongue curled with mine as I cried into her mouth.

My cock throbbed, pulsed, then exploded white heat shooting between our stomachs, smearing us both. My body spasmed. The priestess behind moaned in approval, rubbing her cheek against mine.

<span style="color: blue;">“So much,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“So full of it…”</span>

The priestess in front brought her hand to her lips, licking the cum from her palm.

<span style="color: red;">“Tastes like guilt and longing,”</span> she said. <span style="color: red;">“Perfect.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I need to rest,”</strong> I gasped, but they both laughed.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re far from done, my love.”</span>

<span style="color: red;">“Your seed was the price. Now we collect the reward.”</span>

They lifted me from the water together, as if I weighed nothing and laid me on the mossy bank beside the shrine. My body trembled. My cock twitched, still sensitive, but the attention it drew was fading. My center burned lower now… a pressure deeper inside.

The second priestess lay beside me. She lifted my leg, exposing me. I whimpered.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re open,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“So ready.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Open for what?”</strong>

She didn’t answer with words. Her tongue slid down my navel, then lower. She licked the tender skin around my groin, where the slit of my new pussy had started to bud still raw, undeveloped, but humming with magic. She suckled there gently, her breath searing.

<span style="color: red;">“Do you feel it?”</span> the first priestess asked. <span style="color: red;">“The blessing unfolding inside you?”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I feel… warm,”</strong> I whispered.

<span style="color: red;">“Not warm,”</span> she corrected. <span style="color: red;">“Fertile.”</span>

She knelt between my legs, her cock hard and proud now, glistening with new lust. She pressed her head against my barely formed cleft, not quite entering, just letting me feel her there.

<span style="color: red;">“You won’t forget this,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: red;">“Your body will remember. Even when you’re fully changed. You’ll still ache for this shape.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m not ready.”</strong>

<span style="color: red;">“You’re already hers.”</span> She pushed in.

I screamed. My new slit soft, unfamiliar, not yet a true passage yielded slowly. Her cock stretched me open, the sensation foreign and devastating. It wasn’t pain, not exactly. It was becoming. A slow, tearing joy.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Fffuck too much !”</strong>

The second priestess gripped my hands, kissed me hard.

<span style="color: blue;">“She’s inside you now,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“Both of them. Her… and me.”</span>

The first priestess began to thrust. Slow. Grinding. Every push dragged her cock along nerves that hadn’t existed last moon. Her weight pinned me to the moss, her rhythm deliberate. My chest rose and fell in frantic spasms.

<strong style="color: purple;">“I feel full,”</strong> I gasped. <strong style="color: purple;">“So full ”</strong>

<span style="color: red;">“Take it,”</span> she growled. <span style="color: red;">“Take all of me. Become the Queen she saw.”</span>

I clung to the second priestess, who now sucked one of my nipples between her teeth, tugging, teasing. Her hand stroked my hair, her tongue soothing as I writhed.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re so beautiful,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“You don’t even see it yet.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m… changing…”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Yes.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I don’t want ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“You do.”</span>

The first priestess came with a groan her hips slamming deep, her cock pulsing, spilling into my incomplete womb. I felt her cum flood inside me, hotter than blood, thick and endless.

I arched. My pussy spasmed around her shaft, my body milking her. I came again. My scream echoed through the grove. She collapsed atop me, chest heaving.Then the second priestess whispered:

<span style="color: blue;">“My turn.”</span> The second priestess’s voice was a river in my ear smooth, slow, dragging me downstream toward something inevitable.

<span style="color: blue;">“My turn,”</span> she repeated, with no question in it. Her breath warmed the side of my face as she nuzzled behind my ear, while the first priestess slowly pulled her cock from between my thighs. I whimpered at the loss. Her shaft slid out wetly, a final thick drip of seed spilling after it, trailing down over the small cleft that now throbbed raw and swollen from use. It didn’t bleed no, the goddess wouldn’t allow pain but the ache was real. The emptiness made me clench with unknowing want.

The second priestess moved over me, her body leaner, tighter muscles rolling under smooth, sun browned skin. She straddled me, letting her cock fall forward against my belly, the weight of it as solid and daunting as the stone pillars surrounding us.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re not done,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“Not nearly.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Please,”</strong> I murmured, voice husky. <strong style="color: purple;">“I don’t know if I can take more.”</strong>

She leaned down, her lips brushing mine.

<span style="color: blue;">“You won’t take it,”</span> she said softly. <span style="color: blue;">“You’ll welcome it.”</span>

Then she slid lower, her cock grinding along my still leaking slit, smearing her shaft in her sister priestess’s cum and my own juices. The sensation made my eyes roll back. My hands instinctively clutched at her hips.

<span style="color: blue;">“You feel that?”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“That slippery mess soaking your thighs? That’s you. That’s your body answering.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I I’m not ready to lose it,”</strong> I said. My voice cracked. <strong style="color: purple;">“I’m not ready to become ”</strong>

She hushed me with a kiss, tongue sliding between my lips, patient but firm.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re not losing anything,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“You’re gaining.”</span>

Then she shifted her hips and pushed forward.

I gasped my back arched, legs twitching as her cock spread me open again. I was wetter now. Too slick to stop it. The head slipped past the entrance, and then more… and more…

<strong style="color: purple;">“Nnnnngh goddess ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Say her name,”</span> the priestess whispered.

<strong style="color: purple;">“I ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Say. Her. Name.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Tahlurei!”</strong> I cried. <strong style="color: purple;">“Blessed goddess of seed and sex and AAH !”</strong>

She buried herself fully inside me. My half formed pussy gripped her desperately. My body bucked, overwhelmed by the stretch and heat. She held still for a moment, letting me tremble under her, before beginning to move. Slow. Deliberate. Sacred. She fucked me like a ceremony. Each thrust was accompanied by a whisper:

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re so soft already.”</span>

<span style="color: blue;">“You were never meant to be hard.”</span>

<span style="color: blue;">“She called you from your mother’s womb.”</span>

<span style="color: blue;">“You’ve always belonged to us.”</span>

With each stroke, I opened wider. I felt myself wetting further not from the outside, but within. The warmth deep inside me began to change. The pressure turned to craving. My walls fluttered around her cock, and my body bucked without thought.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Oh gods ”</strong> I gasped. <strong style="color: purple;">“You’re in me so deep I feel like I’m ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Filling,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“Becoming. Let it happen.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m going to come again ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Good. Flood yourself. Mark your womb with your pleasure.”</span>

She reached between us and stroked my tiny cock, still leaking, now dribbling weak spurts of precum that seemed almost pitiful in comparison to the mess inside me. Her fingers rubbed the head in tight circles, matching the rhythm of her thrusts. My legs shook. My voice broke.

<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m  I’m nnnngh aaaaaAAAAH!”</strong>

I came. It wasn’t like the others. It didn’t burst from me in jets it rolled, rippled, soaked from within. My hole spasmed around her cock, milking it. My throat cried out like a prayer. And she came too. With a deep groan, her cock jerked inside me, pulsing again and again. I felt her seed splash against the already coated walls of my half formed womb. It didn’t drip out this time it stayed. My body drank it. Accepted it.

<span style="color: blue;">“Take it,”</span> she growled, her mouth at my ear. <span style="color: blue;">“Every drop. Let it change you.”</span> And I did. My belly burned, but not with pain. It glowed. As though her cum were alchemy. As though her climax was a key and I the lock, now turned. She didn’t pull out. She lay atop me, softening slowly inside, our chests pressed together, our skin slick with sweat and moss.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’ve been claimed,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“The goddess owns you now.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I… don’t know who I am anymore.”</strong>

She smiled. <span style="color: blue;">“You’re becoming who you always were.”</span>

The other priestess joined us, lying beside me. Her lips brushed my shoulder. <span style="color: red;">“And you’ve only just begun.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Was that was that the ritual?”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“No,”</span> said the second. <span style="color: blue;">“That was your first blessing.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“What happens now?”</strong>

Their hands moved over me, caressing me again. I felt their cocks stir once more, their desire never sated.

<span style="color: red;">“Now,”</span> the first priestess said, her tongue flicking along my neck, <span style="color: red;">“you learn what it means to give yourself completely.”</span> And they fucked me again. Over and over. The garden shrine filled with moans and prayers and the wet slap of hips and thighs. The moon passed above. My body shook with ecstasy, my voice reduced to a chorus of ahh nnnngh yes goddess more  until I no longer knew where I ended and they began. I was not prince. Not yet queen. But I was no longer who I had been. And in that sacred water, beneath the carved stone of Velmoria’s oldest altar, I came apart. And I was remade.

[[Wake Up|mc_bed_chamber]]


:: dream_4

I woke but not truly.
Firelight danced on the walls of my tower chamber, flickering amber and gold, fed by logs that hadn’t been there when I went to sleep. Velvet drapes stirred in a breeze that didn’t exist. The scent of night blooming roses sharp, lush, sexual hung heavy in the air. My bed felt too soft. The air, too warm.
And then I saw her.
She stepped from shadow like it parted to let her pass. Her cloak shimmered like starlight dark, speckled with silver patterns that moved when she moved, alive with silent constellations. Beneath its open front, her skin glowed dusky and radiant, curves soft but defined: full breasts swayed slightly with each step, and between her thighs… her cock jutted forward, thick and dark and pulsing with arousal.
Nyssa.
The mage’s assistant.
No more than that. The woman who watched me during potion training with half lidded eyes, who always lingered a moment longer than necessary when adjusting a collar or pressing a vial into my hand. The one who smirked when I blushed, who whispered in riddles laced with hunger.
<span style="color: blue;">“Don’t speak,”</span> she said now, voice husky and low, <span style="color: blue;">“or you’ll wake up.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m already awake,”</strong> I said, my voice ragged.
<span style="color: blue;">“No,”</span> she corrected, stepping closer. <span style="color: blue;">“You’re ready. That’s very different.”</span>
She let the robe slip from her shoulders. It slid down like spilled wine, pooling at her feet.
Her skin was impossibly smooth hips wide, stomach soft, thighs thick enough to crush. Her breasts rose proudly, nipples dark and stiff. Her cock curved forward slightly, long and veined, bobbing with the beat of her heart.
My mouth dried.
I was already hard, my cock stiff and drooling onto my stomach, the silk sheets beneath me damp from the arousal that had dragged me halfway to climax before her voice had even stirred me. I couldn’t remember if I’d touched myself or if this need had simply built by dreaming of her.
She climbed onto the bed like a panther graceful, hungry. I didn’t move. Couldn’t. Her thigh brushed mine, her skin hot as coals. She straddled my lap, her cock sliding alongside mine, her eyes locked on mine.
<span style="color: blue;">“You’ve grown,”</span> she whispered, grinding softly. <span style="color: blue;">“Even after the potions began softening your edges. Even with your poor cock shrinking away night after night…”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">I moaned as our shafts pressed together. Her weight bore down slowly, her hips circling, teasing friction that made my breath catch.</strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">“Y you’ve watched me,”</strong> I whispered. <strong style="color: purple;">“You’ve been there. In the shadows.”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“I’ve guarded you,”</span> she corrected, leaning in. Her lips grazed my jaw, breath warm. <span style="color: blue;">“I’ve seen every change. Every twitch. Every ache. You think the magic hasn’t made you beautiful? That I haven’t wanted you since the first time you cried in your sleep, leaking into your sheets from a dream like this?”</span>
Her cock throbbed against mine.
<strong style="color: purple;">“Please,”</strong> I whispered, though I didn’t know what I was asking for.
<span style="color: blue;">“Not yet,”</span> she said, licking my earlobe. <span style="color: blue;">“I want you to remember this part. The tension. The stretch. The burn. Because one day, when your cock’s finally gone and you ache with emptiness every night… you’ll crave this feeling.”</span>
She reached down, lifted her shaft, and guided it between my thighs. Not into me just between the cheeks of my ass, pressing, grinding slowly, dragging the thick head against the base of my cock.
<span style="color: blue;">“You’re so warm,”</span> she murmured, kissing down my throat. <span style="color: blue;">“So soft back here. You’re almost ready, you know. The cleft’s already forming.”</span>
She leaned back slightly, looking down between us, stroking both our cocks with one hand, her palm slick with our mixed pre.
<span style="color: blue;">“I could slide in so easy,”</span> she purred. <span style="color: blue;">“Just part you like lips part around a tongue.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“Then do it.”</strong>
She chuckled. <span style="color: blue;">“Beg first.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I please,”</strong> I gasped. <strong style="color: purple;">“Put it in. I need it.”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“Mmm… you need it?”</span> she said, grinding harder. <span style="color: blue;">“Say it again. Slower.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I… need your cock inside me.”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“Where?”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“In me. In my my hole.”</strong>
She grabbed my thighs and shoved them higher, pressing them toward my chest. My whole body folded under her.
<span style="color: blue;">“Good girl.”</span>
That name stung and thrilled. She saw it. She believed it.
She lined up and pushed forward.
Her cockhead pressed against the tight, sensitive cleft between my thighs slick with magic and leaking seed and slowly, painfully, slid inside.
<strong style="color: purple;">I cried out, back arching.</strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">“G GODS !”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“Yesss,”</span> she moaned. <span style="color: blue;">“Fuck, you’re tight. Like you were sewn shut and I’m tearing you open.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“You’re too big too thick !”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“And you’re just the right size to take me.”</span>
She began to thrust. Each stroke filled me, then left me gaping before sliding back in. Her cock curved perfectly against the new nerves blooming inside me. My eyes rolled back. My cock bounced uselessly against my belly, twitching, already leaking.
<strong style="color: purple;">“I I’m going to !”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“Not yet,”</span> she snapped. <span style="color: blue;">“Hold it.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I I can’t!”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“You will. Or I stop.”</span>
I sobbed and nodded.
She slowed, then leaned down and kissed me. Her breasts pressed to my chest, her hips grinding into me as her cock stirred every inch of my insides.
<span style="color: blue;">“You don’t understand yet,”</span> she whispered, biting my lip. <span style="color: blue;">“But this is how queens are made. Not with crowns. With consecration. With submission. With cum.”</span>
My hole clenched at her words. I whimpered.
She fucked me harder now. The bed shook. The firelight flickered wildly, casting shadows of her perfect body across the walls. Her moans deepened. Her balls slapped my ass. My own cock slapped wetly against her belly, dripping, untouched, achingly close.
<strong style="color: purple;">“I feel nnngh I feel you everywhere ”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“You’re mine,”</span> she growled. <span style="color: blue;">“Say it.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m yours!”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“You’re my little queen cunt. Say it.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m your queen cunt!”</strong>
She roared her thrusts grew erratic. Her cock throbbed inside me, thickening 
Then she came.
I felt it hot, wet jets flooding my hole, spurting into me again and again until my belly felt tight and full.
And I exploded.
Cum shot from my cock in weak, broken spurts. My body spasmed. My legs trembled. I screamed into her mouth.
She held me through it, rocking gently, riding me down.
When I came back to myself, she was still inside me, softening slowly.
<span style="color: blue;">“I’ll be back,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“When the cock is gone. When you ache between your thighs and your mind is too soft to resist.”</span>
She pulled out with a slow, slick sound.
Her cum dripped from me.
She dressed, shadow cloaking her form again.
And before I could stop her 
She vanished.

:: dream_5
I dreamed of sand.

Not the soft grains of the royal gardens or the powdered marble dust of the palace baths no. This was coarse, wild sand, burnished gold by a sun that never truly set, even in sleep. The kind of sand that stuck to sweat and blood and sex.

I dreamed I was shackled.

Arms stretched overhead, wrists encased in bronze cuffs that clinked softly when I moved. Silk veils hung from the corners of a vast tent around me, dyed in ruby, coral, and burnished gold. The air was thick with incense cardamom, myrrh, and something floral I couldn’t name. A brazier in the corner cast shadows that danced across my bare skin. I was nude, oiled, my body flushed and glistening.

And I wasn’t alone.

She entered like wind made flesh.

Her skin was the color of ancient honey olive dark and luminous under the torchlight. She wore a robe of desert silk, open down the middle to bare her toned stomach, her wide hips, and her massive cock swaying between her thighs, adorned with gold rings and chains. Her breasts were full and high, her nipples pierced with sun shaped studs. A circlet of gold nestled against her brow, framing kohl darkened eyes that glowed with desert heat.

<span style="color: red;">“Prince of Velmoria,”</span> she said, and her voice was a caress, thick and slow. <span style="color: red;">“So far from your mountain cradle. So close to your blooming.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">I swallowed.</strong>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Wh who are you?”</strong>

She smiled, and it made something stir in my belly.

<span style="color: red;">“I am Empress Azhara, blood of flame and heir of the scorched sands. And you… are my bridal gift.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m not yours,”</strong> I said, though my voice cracked. <strong style="color: purple;">“I didn’t agree to ”</strong>

Her hand caught my chin.

Her grip was firm. Not cruel. But commanding.

<span style="color: red;">“Oh, little flower,”</span> she purred. <span style="color: red;">“This is a dream. Agreement is irrelevant. What matters… is reaction.”</span>

She moved closer. I could smell her skin spiced and warm, like sun heated metal. Her cock hung inches from mine, thick and pulsing, the head already glistening. I was hard too. Shamefully so. Despite my fear. Despite the chain. Or because of it.

<span style="color: red;">“You’ve changed since last we met,”</span> she said, trailing a nail down my chest. <span style="color: red;">“Your hips… softer. Your cock… smaller.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I didn’t ask for this,”</strong> I hissed.

<span style="color: red;">“No. But you needed it.”</span>

Her hand closed around my shaft. I gasped.

<span style="color: red;">“Still so sensitive,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: red;">“Even when it twitches like a candle’s last flame.”</span>

Her other hand stroked her own cock, dragging the heavy length across my thigh. It smeared precum across my skin, leaving a hot, sticky trail.

<span style="color: red;">“Do you feel it, little flower?”</span> she murmured, pressing our cocks together. <span style="color: red;">“That fire? That ache? That is what we give our brides before they bloom.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Bride?”</strong> I choked. <strong style="color: purple;">“I’m no one’s bride.”</strong>

She leaned in, tongue teasing my earlobe.

<span style="color: red;">“Oh, but you will be. Your body is being readied for it. The magic you drink. The training you endure. It all leads here: to surrender. To silk. To seed.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m not ready,”</strong> I whispered.

She chuckled, deep and rich.

<span style="color: red;">“Your cock says otherwise.”</span>

She began to stroke me both of us gripping our shafts in one hand, rubbing their tips together. The slick heat of her drove my senses wild. My hips rocked forward, helpless, hungry.

<span style="color: red;">“There,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: red;">“Let your body speak. Words are for resistance. Your moans, though… your moans are truth.”</span>

I bit my lip, but still a groan escaped.

<span style="color: red;">“You like how I feel,”</span> she said. <span style="color: red;">“Say it.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I… I like it,”</strong> I gasped.

<span style="color: red;">“Do you like this?”</span> she asked, thrusting her cock along mine again, her shaft grinding into my belly.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Yes !”</strong>

<span style="color: red;">“And this?”</span> She lowered her head, kissed me. Her tongue claimed my mouth with slow, sensuous power.

<strong style="color: purple;">I moaned into her, my chains clinking softly above me.</strong>

Her hand dropped lower, fingers sliding along the cleft between my cheeks probing, teasing. I flinched.

<strong style="color: purple;">“No… wait…”</strong>

<span style="color: red;">“Hush,”</span> she said. <span style="color: red;">“I’ll not take until you beg. But I will show you.”</span>

She knelt before me, lips parting around my cock. I gasped as she took me into her mouth, heat engulfing me. Her tongue flicked the head, then swirled down the shaft. She sucked me slowly, savoring, dragging every sound from my throat.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Azhara gods ahh, please !”</strong>

She pulled back.

<span style="color: red;">“Good,”</span> she said. <span style="color: red;">“I want you desperate. I want your body to betray every princely oath.”</span>

She stood again, and with one motion, bent me forward.

The dream shimmered.

My shackles vanished.

I was on my knees.

Before her cock.

She gripped it and pressed it to my lips.

<span style="color: red;">“You know what to do.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">I looked up at her. “You’re… huge.”</strong>

<span style="color: red;">“And you’re hungry. Take it.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">I opened my mouth.</strong>

She slid in.

Her cock filled my throat inch by inch. I gagged, then relaxed. She moaned above me, her hands in my hair, guiding. Not forcing. Just… leading.

<span style="color: red;">“Yes,”</span> she said. <span style="color: red;">“Take me, pretty prince. Show me how badly you want to be bred.”</span>

I sucked her, bobbing my head, tongue pressed along the underside of her shaft. She rolled her hips, fucking my mouth with slow, heavy thrusts.

<span style="color: red;">“You’re good at this,”</span> she said, breath ragged. <span style="color: red;">“Almost like you were trained for it.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">I moaned around her.</strong>

She pulled out with a pop.

<span style="color: red;">“On the bed.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">I obeyed.</strong>

The silk was cool against my skin.

She climbed over me, her cock now resting against my newly forming slit. The heat of her was unbearable. She pressed against me not entering just rubbing, teasing the entrance with steady pressure.

<span style="color: red;">“I want you to ask for it.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I please ”</strong>

<span style="color: red;">“Ask.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Breed me,”</strong> I whispered. <strong style="color: purple;">“I want it. Fill me. Make me yours.”</strong>

Her eyes burned like dusk fire.

<span style="color: red;">“Now you’re speaking the language of queens.”</span>

And she entered.

Slowly.

Deeply.

With infinite power.

:: dream_6

The water shimmered crimson under candlelight perfumed steam curling up in rose scented ribbons. Cinnamon lingered on the air, heavy and rich, curling in my nose and behind my eyes like memory.
The marble bath stretched wide beneath me, veins of silver running like ancient script through the red stone. The tub had no edge, only a smooth lip that let water flow endlessly into the tiled floor, like blood from an open wound that never dried. I lay against the sloped back, arms draped lazily to either side, thighs parted, the warm water lapping at my hips.
I should have been ashamed.
I should have covered myself.
But the dream had no space for modesty.
Only sensation.
Two figures moved around me with reverence.
Maera my longtime attendant, with soft dark curls pinned high, her olive skin glowing in the flickering light was closest. Her robe was sheer, so thin it may as well have been fog. Her nipples peeked through the gauze like dusky buds, and when she leaned forward to pour water across my chest, her full breasts swayed softly beneath the fabric.
<span style="color: red;">“You’re very quiet tonight, my prince,”</span> she murmured, her voice like warm milk and slow kisses. <span style="color: red;">“Is the water too hot?”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“No,”</strong> I said softly. <strong style="color: purple;">“It’s perfect.”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“You look flushed.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I… feel different.”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“You are,”</span> she said, dipping the sponge in the water again. <span style="color: red;">“Different every night now. Softer. Warmer. It suits you.”</span>
I should have bristled. But the sponge brushed across my chest, and I melted instead.
<strong style="color: purple;">“And who’s… the new one?”</strong> I asked, as the second attendant knelt at the far end of the tub.
She hadn’t spoken since I arrived. Her hair was raven black, long and straight, falling in a curtain down her back. Her eyes were violet unnatural, vivid, like shards of amethyst catching fire. She wore lace. Just lace. A sheer slip of black that clung to the curves of her hips and dipped just barely over her cock, which twitched visibly with every movement beneath the fabric.
Maera smiled, dipping the sponge lower, letting it swirl across my belly.
<span style="color: red;">“She’s a gift,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: red;">“A temporary indulgence. Her name doesn’t matter. Only her mouth.”</span>
The violet eyed girl looked up at me.
Her lips parted, but no words came.
Just the quiet flick of her tongue against her lower lip.
<strong style="color: purple;">“She doesn’t speak?”</strong> I asked.
<span style="color: red;">“She hasn’t needed to,”</span> Maera replied.
Then her voice dipped lower.
<span style="color: red;">“But you will.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">I gasped as the girl’s hands slid along my thighs underwater, parting them gently. Her mouth kissed the inside of my knee. Then lower. Then </strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">“Ohh… gods…”</strong>
Her tongue brushed the underside of my cock.
Maera giggled softly. <span style="color: red;">“You’re already so sensitive. And so… small.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">I bit my lip.</strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">“You’ve noticed it too,”</strong> I said, almost a confession.
She nodded, her eyes kind and unashamed.
<span style="color: red;">“You’re shrinking, Caelan. In all the right places.”</span>
The girl’s tongue traced a slow line up my shaft. My cock twitched in response, helpless. Her lips wrapped around the head, and I moaned softly.
<span style="color: red;">“You feel no shame?”</span> Maera asked.
<strong style="color: purple;">“No,”</strong> I whispered, panting.
<span style="color: red;">“Good. That’s a queen’s first freedom. No shame in pleasure.”</span>
She let the sponge fall aside and climbed into the tub with me. Her robe clung wetly to her skin, nipples stiff against the fabric. She sat beside me, one leg draped over mine, her fingers tracing small circles around my nipple.
The girl between my legs sucked harder now lips tight, tongue flicking slurping, wet and obscene.
<strong style="color: purple;">“Fuck ahhh ”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“Language,”</span> Maera whispered, flicking my nipple. <span style="color: red;">“You’ll need to speak more like a lady soon.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I I can’t think ”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“That’s her job.”</span>
The girl moaned around my cock, humming as she absorbed. The vibration made me buck.
Maera leaned in, kissed my temple.
<span style="color: red;">“You taste different, too,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: red;">“More honey than salt. More maiden than man.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“You’ve tasted me?”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“Many times. You just don’t remember. Dreams are strange like that.”</span>
The girl sucked harder now. My hands gripped the sides of the tub. Maera’s fingers pinched my nipple, rolled it between her fingers.
<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m gonna g gonna come ”</strong>
Maera purred, tongue licking my earlobe.
<span style="color: red;">“Then let her drink it. You’ve earned it.”</span>
I cried out, hips lifting as I spilled into the violet eyed girl’s mouth. She drank every drop, her eyes never leaving mine.
And when I was empty 
She kept going.
Licking.
Sucking.
Teasing.
<strong style="color: purple;">“Oh gods too much !”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“She doesn’t stop until I tell her,”</span> Maera whispered. <span style="color: red;">“And I haven’t.”</span>
The girl moaned again, cock now fully hard beneath the lace. It throbbed against the edge of the tub. She grinded against the marble, soft cries escaping her throat.
Maera leaned down and kissed me on the lips.
It wasn’t gentle.
It was possession.
<span style="color: red;">“You’re going to be beautiful,”</span> she said. <span style="color: red;">“Your pussy will open like a rose. Your skin will glow like morning silk. And when that day comes…”</span>
She looked down at the girl between my legs.
<span style="color: red;">“…she’ll fuck you properly.”</span>
The girl moaned in agreement, her tongue now tracing down lower… toward the cleft.
Toward the new part of me.
<strong style="color: purple;">My breath caught.</strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I there’s nothing there yet ”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“There is,”</span> Maera said, her hand now sliding between my legs. <span style="color: red;">“Feel it? That softness? That line forming? That warmth that wasn’t there last week?”</span>
Her fingers pressed.
<strong style="color: purple;">I gasped.</strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">“Yes… yes I feel it…”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“She’ll make love to that. Gently. And then… less gently.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">I whimpered as the girl’s tongue traced the forming slit.</strong>
Maera kissed me again.
<span style="color: red;">“You’re already wet.”</span>
And I was.

Maera’s breath was sweet with wine and rose. Her fingers wet from the bath, slick from my body caressed lower now. Past the base of my softening cock. Further down, between my thighs. She parted me.
Not completely.
Not yet.
But enough.
I felt the warmth again.
The ache.
The split.
The place where something new had begun to form.
A line that had deepened each week, where skin once unbroken now pulsed and throbbed with unfamiliar need.
<span style="color: red;">“She’s right here,”</span> Maera whispered, voice honey thick. <span style="color: red;">“Just beneath the surface.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I she?”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“You,”</span> Maera corrected. <span style="color: red;">“The real you. You’re softening in all the right ways.”</span>
The maid’s tongue pressed there. Lower now. Slower. She licked the line, flicked her tongue gently against it, coaxing moans from deep in my chest I didn’t recognize as mine.
<span style="color: blue;">“You taste like a promise,”</span> she said suddenly her voice dreamy, faintly accented. <span style="color: blue;">“Like sex that’s still becoming. I love that taste.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">I gasped.</strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">“You can… speak.”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“She speaks when it matters,”</span> Maera murmured. <span style="color: red;">“And it matters now.”</span>
The maid’s mouth found me again. Her tongue was insistent, wet and strong and slow. She licked between my thighs in steady circles, teasing the forming slit, sucking just under my balls. Every time she moaned, it vibrated through my hips.
<strong style="color: purple;">I squirmed.</strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">“Fuck, that feels ah too good ”</strong>
Maera kissed my neck, then bit gently at my collarbone.
<span style="color: red;">“You’ll stop saying ‘fuck’ eventually. You’ll say ‘gods’ instead. Or ‘please.’ Or nothing at all, because you’ll be too full to speak.”</span>
The maid lifted her head slightly, her lips slick with my sweat and her spit.
<span style="color: blue;">“He’s already dripping,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“And I haven’t even slid my cock in yet.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">I looked down.</strong>
Her cock strained against the black lace, tip already leaking. The lace was nearly transparent, soaked with her arousal.
Maera reached down and tugged it aside.
<strong style="color: purple;">“Oh gods ”</strong>
It sprang free thick, straight, veined and flushed, the head wide and flat, dark as ripe berries. She pumped it slowly, eyes half lidded, watching me writhe.
<span style="color: red;">“She’s not going to fuck you, Caelan,”</span> Maera whispered. <span style="color: red;">“Not unless you ask.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I don’t ”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“Ask,”</span> she repeated. <span style="color: red;">“This dream only goes as far as your voice allows.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I… I don’t know how.”</strong>
The maid knelt between my legs again, her cock brushing my thigh, painting me with precum. Her eyes were focused, but gentle.
<span style="color: blue;">“You want me to show you,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“Say it.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I… want you to show me.”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“Where do you want me?”</span>
Maera kissed my ear.
<span style="color: red;">“Say it, Caelan. Where?”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">I closed my eyes.</strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">“In my… new place. Between.”</strong>
The maid grinned.
<span style="color: blue;">“Say ‘pussy.’”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">I blushed.</strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I can’t.”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“You can,”</span> Maera whispered. <span style="color: red;">“You have one now. Even if it’s not done blooming. Even if it’s still learning what it is. Say it. Claim it.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">I opened my mouth.</strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">“My… pussy.”</strong>
The word fell like a stone in a still pond.
Both women sighed.
<span style="color: red;">“There,”</span> Maera purred. <span style="color: red;">“There she is.”</span>
The maid aligned her cock with me. I could feel it right there, thick and hot, nudging against my forming cleft. The pressure made me arch.
<strong style="color: purple;">“I don’t think I can take it,”</strong> I whispered.
<span style="color: blue;">“You don’t take it,”</span> the maid said. <span style="color: blue;">“You receive. You welcome.”</span>
Her cockhead pressed harder, parting the new folds gently.
<strong style="color: purple;">And she slid inside.</strong>
<strong style="color: purple;">I screamed.</strong>
A high, sharp moan not pain, not entirely. Just overload.
Every nerve exploded as she buried the head inside me.
<span style="color: blue;">“It’s so tight,”</span> the maid gasped, holding still. <span style="color: blue;">“You’re already clutching me. Fuck ”</span>
Maera kissed me, long and deep. Her tongue silenced my cries. Her fingers held my thighs open as the maid began to thrust.
Slowly.
She rocked her hips, working inch after inch inside me, letting my body adjust.
<span style="color: blue;">“You’re perfect,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“You’re so warm. So wet. You were made for this.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I I feel you everywhere ”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“You should.”</span>
Her cock slid deeper. The shape of her stretched me open in a way I didn’t know I could take. But I did. My legs trembled, my back arched. I groaned as her hips pressed flush with mine.
Maera brushed hair from my eyes, lips brushing my cheek.
<span style="color: red;">“Say it again,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: red;">“Say what she’s fucking.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“My… pussy.”</strong>
Louder.
<strong style="color: purple;">“My pussy.”</strong>
The maid fucked me harder.
<strong style="color: purple;">My voice broke into a cry.</strong>
I felt her cock slide against something inside me something tender and new. A place that hadn’t existed before this year. It sent lightning through my spine.
<strong style="color: purple;">“There gods there!”</strong>
She found it again.
And again.
My pussy clenched, pulsing, spasming with raw pleasure.
<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m gonna g gonna ”</strong>
<span style="color: blue;">“Come,”</span> the maid said. <span style="color: blue;">“Come on my cock.”</span>
Maera kissed me as I screamed.
I came.
Not from my cock. It barely twitched, a small spurt painting my belly. But the real climax came from deeper from within. My pussy clenched, waves of release crashing over me. I cried into Maera’s mouth.
The maid fucked me through it.
And then she came too.
With a low, guttural moan, she drove deep, hips jerking. Her cock pulsed inside me, flooding me with thick, hot seed. I felt it spill, then stay. My hole clung to her, keeping it in.
She collapsed over me, face buried in my neck.
Maera smiled.
<span style="color: red;">“There,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: red;">“You’ve been bathed. And now you’ve been blessed.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">“I… I can’t feel my legs.”</strong>
<span style="color: red;">“You won’t need them. You’ll be carried.”</span>
The bathwater shimmered.
I looked down.
My cock was smaller again.
My new cleft swollen, lips flushed and full.
My body… changing.
Dreaming.
Becoming.
Maera held me as I faded into sleep.
<span style="color: red;">“You’ll remember this,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: red;">“Every time you ache. Every time you wet your sheets. You’ll remember what it’s like to be full.”</span>
<strong style="color: purple;">I moaned softly, eyes closing.</strong>
And I did.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_7/1.png">><</passage_img>>

The mirror loomed before me like a portal. It was impossibly tall reaching from obsidian floor to vaulted ceiling its frame carved from a single piece of lunar ivory, etched with glyphs that shimmered as if alive. It didn’t reflect the room. It reflected me. Only me. Me, naked. Me, exposed. Me, changed.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_7/2.png">><</passage_img>>

My chest rose and fell with shallow breaths, each exhale fogging the lower edge of the glass. I watched the vapor bloom like petals and fade just as quickly. My skin glistened with some faint oil I didn’t remember applying. My nipples were darker now, more sensitive. My waist curved. My hips, rounder. My cock… smaller.

I stood at the threshold of something I couldn’t name. And then I felt her. Not saw. Felt. Heat at my back. Power curling around me like a fog of perfume and static. Her breath didn’t touch my skin but my skin ached for it. In the mirror, my reflection shimmered. And then she appeared.

Archmage stepped into view from behind my mirrored self. But I felt no footsteps. She emerged as though pulled from the glass itself. Her robes were gone, discarded like illusions. Her body was carved from radiance skin like polished bronze, runes glowing faintly down her arms and thighs, the sigils shifting when I blinked. Between her legs hung power incarnate.

She radiated both woman and something more cock semi erect, thick with veins that pulsed in rhythm with my own heartbeat. I stared, breathless, helpless. She pressed against me her bare skin hot against my back, the weight of her presence anchoring me in place. Her hands slid over my shoulders, palms firm, grounding. In the mirror, her face hovered just above my own, her eyes glowing soft violet.

<span style="color: blue;">“This is your last reflection,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“After tonight… the mirror will not remember this shape.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Am I dreaming?”</strong> I asked, though my voice was a whisper.

<span style="color: blue;">“Yes,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“But dreams are only rehearsals. The real performance comes after.”</span> Her hands slid down, brushing the sides of my chest, stopping just above my ribs.

<span style="color: blue;">“I’ve watched you resist,”</span> she murmured. <span style="color: blue;">“Every lesson. Every spell. Every potion. And still… look at you.”</span> I looked. I saw the swell of my chest. The curve of my thighs. The tension in my expression caught between shame and longing.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re scared,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“That means you’re close.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Close to what?”</strong> I asked, throat tight.

<span style="color: blue;">“To truth.”</span> Her hands slid lower down my sides, fingers pressing gently into the softening flesh of my hips.

<span style="color: blue;">“To the moment you stop pretending this was someone else’s decision.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I didn’t choose this,”</strong> I said.

<span style="color: blue;">“No?”</span> she asked, her voice thick with something between affection and amusement. <span style="color: blue;">“Then why did you always watch me when I prepared the elixirs? Why did your cock twitch when I spoke the incantations?”</span> My eyes met hers in the mirror.

<strong style="color: purple;">“I… didn’t know what I was feeling.”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“You do now.”</span> She leaned forward, her chin resting lightly on my shoulder.

<span style="color: blue;">“Do you feel it?”</span> she murmured. <span style="color: blue;">“The tension in your thighs. The heat between them. That ache that isn’t fear. That throb that isn’t shame.”</span> Her cock pressed between my cheeks not entering. Not forcing. Just… there. Heavy. Hot. Present.

<strong style="color: purple;">I gasped.</strong>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I feel…”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Say it.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I feel… need.”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Good.”</span> She grinded slowly not thrusting, just dragging the weight of herself along the cleft that now existed between me. Her cockhead pressed against the spot just above it where something raw and tender had begun to bloom.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re not ready for me to take you,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“Not yet. But you are ready to feel what will be missed.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Missed?”</strong> I asked. She exhaled against my neck.

<span style="color: blue;">“Your cock is fading, Caelan,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“And you’ll miss it. Even when you love what you become.”</span> My hips rocked involuntarily. Her body felt right against mine. Her power surged around us like an invisible tide. My reflection was trembling. Not from fear. From craving. Her hands lifted to my chest. She cupped my budding breasts, thumbs stroking my nipples.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re forming. Your body is learning new pleasure. New thresholds. The king inside you was an echo. This is voice. This is your song.”</span> She began to rock, her cock sliding rhythmically against me.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’ll remember this,”</span> she murmured. <span style="color: blue;">“Even when it’s gone. The friction. The weight. The way you opened from behind instead of welcoming. Your pussy will ache, and your mind will remember this.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">I cried out softly, head falling back against her shoulder.</strong>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I’m going to…”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Yes,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“Let it happen.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">I came.</strong> Not hard. Not violently. But slow. A steady release, pulled from me by friction and rhythm and the words she wove into my skin. My cock spasmed one last time small, weak, clinging to relevance. I saw the cum smear the mirror. I saw myself collapse inward.

<strong style="color: purple;">“I…”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re leaving it behind,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“You’re not losing anything.”</span> She stepped back. And I turned to face her. Naked. Open. Changed. She kissed me not with fire, but with certainty. When I looked back at the mirror I saw a girl. Soft. Wet. Panting. Me.And the mirror did not fog again.

I stared at the mirror, but I didn’t recognize what stared back. Not fully. It was me. It had my eyes. My mouth. But there was a soft curve to the lips now, parted and glistening from breath and arousal. The cheeks were flushed a shade that spoke of deep blood flow beneath softening skin. The neck longer, more slender. The shoulders narrower. And below the waist I couldn’t look away.

My cock still there, but less than it had been lay draped against my thigh. Small. Damp. Dripping the last of what She had drawn from me. Beneath it, my sack had retreated slightly, the flesh between faintly parted, like lips just beginning to breathe. She stood behind me.

She was still hard. Still radiant. Still watching me like a sculptor seeing her work reach the cusp of perfection. Her cock pulsed still slick from grinding into me veins luminous with runes. Her nipples stood stiff above her tight, sculpted abs. The runes on her thighs shimmered in cadence with my breathing.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re seeing the truth,”</span> she said, her voice even softer now. <span style="color: blue;">“It doesn’t frighten you anymore, does it?”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“It should,”</strong> I whispered. <strong style="color: purple;">“But it doesn’t.”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Because your body recognizes it,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“Even when your mind tries to name it other.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I feel…”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Speak.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“…whole,”</strong> I whispered. She smiled.

<span style="color: blue;">“There it is,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“The first honest word from your lips since we began this long, slow blooming.”</span> She stepped closer, her cock brushing my ass again.

<span style="color: blue;">“Do you want me?”</span> she asked, not a trace of teasing in her voice. I didn’t answer. I watched myself. I touched the glass. And then 

<strong style="color: purple;">I nodded.</strong> She bent slightly, her cock resting now along the cleft between my cheeks again. Her hands caressed my hips.

<span style="color: blue;">“Then ask.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I want you.”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Where?”</span> I hesitated. She leaned down.

<span style="color: blue;">“Not there,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“Not yet. You’re not ready.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Then how?”</strong> She kissed the back of my neck.

<span style="color: blue;">“I will show you another way.”</span> Her cock, still slick, pressed lower not into me but beneath me. Between my thighs. She slid it forward, until the head emerged between the front of my legs, nestling against my softening cock. The size difference was staggering. Her head throbbed beside mine, veined and flushed. She rocked her hips, dragging it through the forming cleft.

<strong style="color: purple;">I gasped.</strong>

Her rhythm was slow. Not to tease but to teach. My thighs closed instinctively, holding her in place. Her hands never left my hips. Her mouth brushed my shoulder.

<span style="color: blue;">“This is how your body learns,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“It’s not the thrust. Not the finish. It’s the slide. The way I move through the place where you’re changing. The place that wants more even when it’s not ready to be filled.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">I whimpered.</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“You like the friction,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“Say it.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I do…”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“You like my cock sliding through your thighs, rubbing your new pussy, pressing against what’s left of your old self.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Y yes…”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“You’ll never forget this,”</span> she whispered.

<strong style="color: purple;">“I don’t want to.”</strong>

She moaned low, almost surprised at her own pleasure. The base of her cock slapped my skin with each grind. My thighs squeezed tighter. Her head leaked pre onto my belly, a slow, steady droplet trailing downward.

<span style="color: blue;">“I could fuck you like this,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“Forever.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Do it.”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“No. You have more to become. But you can come again. Right here. With me. Like this.”</span> She reached forward, wrapped her hand around both cocks hers and mine stroking them together.

<span style="color: blue;">“Let it happen.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Let me make you climax like the thing you are becoming.”</span>

I moaned into the mirror, watching her arm move behind me. Watching her cock slide between my legs, glistening. Watching my own twitch helplessly.

<span style="color: blue;">“You feel so soft,”</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">“So fucking soft. Gods, Caelan…”</span>

I came. Again. My cock twitched in her hand, spurting one final, thin line of release across the mirror. But it was her cock that throbbed longer, harder, pulsing as it spilled between my legs, hot and thick and endless. We both gasped. Her forehead rested against my neck. The cum ran down my thighs, pooled against my cleft, soaked the floor. In the mirror, the reflection shifted.

My cock… Smaller again. The line beneath it darker. My pussy, not yet complete, now real. I looked over my shoulder. She stared at me. Her eyes weren’t glowing now. They were human. Gentle. Proud.

<span style="color: blue;">“This was your final dream as prince,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“The next one… you wake a queen.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Will you still be there?”</strong> I asked.

<span style="color: blue;">“Only if you call for me.”</span> I turned to face her.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Archmage…”</strong> She kissed me. And vanished. The mirror rippled once. Then cracked. And the last image it showed  Was her. Me. As I would become. And I smiled.

:: dream_8
<<passage_img "dream/dream_8/1.png">><</passage_img>>

The light in the grove had no sun. It came from the petals themselves from golden flowers that swayed with breathless rhythm, their stamens pulsing, their edges glowing with living color. The air tasted like nectar and summer wine, thick with perfume that licked the back of my throat and fogged my thoughts.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_8/2.png">><</passage_img>>

I stood among the blossoms barefoot, the ground impossibly soft beneath my soles. The petals brushed against my legs, against my thighs, higher like fingers curious and alive. I gasped when one brushed against the cleft forming just beneath my groin. And then… they came. Fae. Not men. Not women. Not anything mortal. They drifted into view, rising from the flowers, born of pollen and heat and silver laughter. Naked and glowing, their wings hummed like harps, catching the gold filtered breeze. 

<<passage_img "dream/dream_8/3.png">><</passage_img>>

Their bodies were delicate and sharp all at once breasts high and full, cocks sheathed in petals, lips shaped like kisses, their skin painted in the hues of fruit and moonlight. They circled me like dancers.

<span style="color: red;">"Caelan…"</span> they sang in voices layered with sweetness and menace, <span style="color: red;">"You wander far from stone and steel. Is it the crown you run from… or the self that grows beneath it?"</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I don’t know what I’m becoming,”</strong> I whispered.

One of them landed graceful, bare feet kissing the flowers. She was taller than the others, wings shimmering like crushed gems, her eyes a shade I’d never seen. Her breasts jutted proudly, and below them her sex was doubled wet lips glistening, cock already stiff and curved, veins traced with vines of glowing ink.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_8/4.png">><</passage_img>>

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re not here to know,”</span> she said, stepping closer. <span style="color: blue;">“You’re here to feel.”</span> She pressed her body to mine skin like soft flame, heat rolling from her in waves. I felt her cock bump against my thigh, her pussy smear slickness across my skin.

<span style="color: blue;">“Your heart is confused,”</span> she whispered, tracing her fingers over my chest. <span style="color: blue;">“But your body? It knows.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">I trembled. “I… don’t know what to do.”</strong> Another fae giggled from behind me, sliding arms around my waist.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_8/5.png">><</passage_img>>

<span style="color: green;">“Then we’ll do it for you.”</span> They guided me down among the blossoms. The taller fae straddled my lap, her pussy already slick, grinding along the length of my shrunken cock. She rocked her hips, coating me in warmth. Her cock pressed against my belly.

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re so ready,”</span> she said, her lips brushing my ear. <span style="color: blue;">“Even if your body hasn’t caught up. That tension you feel between your thighs… that’s your petals opening.”</span>

The fae behind me reached down, fingers gliding over my entrance over the not quite pussy I’d felt growing in my dreams. I panted.

<span style="color: green;">“You’re wet,”</span> she purred. <span style="color: green;">“Already leaking like one of us.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I feel… open,”</strong> I whispered.

<span style="color: green;">“You are. And one kiss from us…”</span> The fae in my lap leaned in, lips brushing mine.

<span style="color: blue;">“…and your body becomes a gift.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“A gift to whom?”</strong> She smiled, slow and honey sweet.

<span style="color: blue;">“To the Queen of Flowers.”</span> She kissed me. My mind shattered like glass.

Her kiss wasn’t like any I had known. There was no breath, no tongue, not at first. Just pressure, infinite and soft, blooming against my lips like the unfurling of a flower. I tasted sunlight and rainwater. I tasted pollen. I tasted the ache in my belly that had haunted me since the rites began the ache of not knowing where my body ended anymore, or what I was becoming. When her tongue slid past my lips, it was not to conquer it was to teach.

<span style="color: blue;">"Do you feel it now?"</span> she asked as she pulled back, her forehead pressed to mine. <span style="color: blue;">"The pull. The melt. The letting go."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">"Yes,"</strong> I whispered, dazed, eyes half closed. <strong style="color: purple;">"It’s like… something’s softening in me. Inside."</strong> The fae around us hummed in approval. Their wings fluttered like petals in wind.

<span style="color: green;">"You’re blooming,"</span> one said, stroking my hair. <span style="color: green;">"We’ve been waiting for it."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">"But I’m still "</strong> I looked down. My cock, smaller now than ever, glistened with fae nectar. Between my thighs, the lips of my forming cleft gleamed wet and full.

<span style="color: red;">"You’re still both,"</span> said the one behind me, her hands warm against my ribs. <span style="color: red;">"Both is beautiful. Both is real."</span>

<span style="color: orange;">"You needn’t decide,"</span> said another, flicking my nipple with a mischievous grin. <span style="color: orange;">"Just receive."</span> The one straddling me ground her hips again, her slick folds pressing down along my shaft, her cock rubbing against my stomach. I cried out softly there was no shame, only heat.

<span style="color: blue;">"I can feel you shaking,"</span> she murmured. <span style="color: blue;">"You want to sink into this."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">"Yes,"</strong> I panted.

<span style="color: blue;">"You want to give your body up to something older than kings."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">"Yes."</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">"You want to stop choosing, and just open."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">"Yes gods, yes."</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">"Then say it."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">"I want to be taken,"</strong> I said. <strong style="color: purple;">"I want to be used."</strong> Her smile was radiant.

<span style="color: blue;">"We don’t take,"</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">"We harvest."</span> She lifted her hips slightly and reached between us. Her hand curled around both our shafts her cock and mine lining them up with her dripping folds. She rubbed the heads together, soaking me in her warmth. My hips bucked helplessly.

<span style="color: blue;">"Are you ready to be pollinated, little prince?"</span> she asked.

<strong style="color: purple;">"Yes,"</strong> I breathed. <strong style="color: purple;">"Please "</strong> She didn’t lower all at once. She sank down in slow, rippling waves. Her pussy took us both her cock resting atop mine as her walls enveloped us. My breath caught as she bottomed out, her warmth swallowing every inch of what I had left.

<span style="color: red;">"You’re inside her,"</span> whispered the fae behind me. <span style="color: red;">"And so is she inside you."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">I moaned, unable to speak.</strong> Her folds were tight and alive, milking me. Her inner muscles pulsed in rhythm with her wings, massaging me in undulating waves. She rolled her hips, grinding deeper.

<span style="color: blue;">"Do you feel how perfect this is?"</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">"This isn’t fucking. This is grafting. This is what vines do when they entwine."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">My hands clutched her thighs. She was slick with nectar, her skin glowing gold where it touched mine. Her cock throbbed against my belly with each thrust.</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">"You don’t know where you end and I begin,"</span> she said.

<strong style="color: purple;">"I don’t,"</strong> I moaned. <strong style="color: purple;">"I can’t tell anymore "</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">"And you like it."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">"I love it."</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">"Say it again."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">"I love it."</strong> Around us, the other fae moved in closer. One knelt behind me, her hands stroking my back, her lips kissing down my spine. Another kissed my shoulders, then my chest, her lips closing around a nipple and sucking gently.

<span style="color: orange;">"You're feeding from us,"</span> said the one on my chest. <span style="color: orange;">"Like a sapling from the roots."</span>

<span style="color: red;">"And you're growing,"</span> said the one behind. <span style="color: red;">"Your pussy’s swelling. It's ready."</span> The fae riding me moaned low and deep, her body spasming around mine.

<span style="color: blue;">"I’m going to come,"</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">"And when I do, you’ll feel it in your womb."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">"But "</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">"You have one now,"</span> she said, biting her lip. <span style="color: blue;">"You just haven’t felt it yet."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">I arched as she fucked me harder, faster. My cock twitched against her length. Her walls gripped me tighter, heat building in my core.</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">"You’ll remember this,"</span> she said. <span style="color: blue;">"Every time your thighs ache. Every time your cunt drips without touching. Every time your dreams smell like nectar."</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">"I'm going to I'm "</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">"Do it,"</span> she hissed. <span style="color: blue;">"Come for us. Spill inside. Let us bloom you."</span>

I came. The orgasm tore through me like a spell. My cock pulsed weakly between our bellies, but it wasn’t the release that overwhelmed me it was hers.

She came at the same moment, her pussy clenching hard, her cock spurting between us, soaking my chest. Her warmth flooded my forming slit, and in that moment I felt it. A deep, low thrum inside me. Like something opening. Accepting. Holding. I collapsed into the flowers. She held me. The other fae curled around us like petals folding at nightfall.

<span style="color: green;">"You’re so beautiful,"</span> one whispered.

<span style="color: orange;">"You’ve begun to bloom."</span>

<span style="color: red;">"Your womb has tasted magic."</span>

<span style="color: green;">"You belong to the Grove now."</span>

<span style="color: orange;">"You are a gift."</span>

<span style="color: red;">"And one day, your gift will bear fruit."</span>

I didn’t remember boarding a ship. But I was on one. That much was clear. The wood creaked beneath my boots as I staggered to keep upright, the entire vessel heaving on monstrous waves. Sea spray hissed through the cracks in the bulkhead, and thunder cracked above like the laugh of some old god. Lanterns swung in wide arcs, shadows careening madly across the planks. And yet, I wasn’t afraid.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_9/2.png">><</passage_img>>

I was aroused. Not by the storm. By what was coming below deck. I heard the voices first, rough and low, not raised in alarm but laughter. Teasing, hungry, obscene. One voice was deep and wet with a growl; the other higher, clever, laced with mischief. The door slammed open and I was pulled inside. And there they were.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_9/3.png">><</passage_img>>

Two sailor girls, bare chested, sweat slicked, eyes gleaming like polished brass. The first broad shouldered, arms thick with rope heaving muscle had sea blown red hair and tattoos scrawled across her collarbone and hips. Her cock hung thick and heavy between her thighs, already hard, glistening at the tip like a loaded cannon. She grinned when she saw me.

<span style="color: blue;">“Finally decided to join us, stormboy,”</span> she said, voice thick as tar.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_9/4.png">><</passage_img>>

The other curvier, darker, hips like waves breaking on shore crawled toward me on hands and knees. Her breasts swung free, her pussy visibly swollen, lips puffed and glistening. She licked her lips.

<span style="color: green;">“He doesn’t need land to dock,”</span> she purred. <span style="color: green;">“Just somewhere warm and tight.”</span>

I opened my mouth to speak, but the redhead grabbed my shirt, spun me against a barrel, and kissed me hard.Her mouth was brutal. Tongue deep. Hungry. She tasted like salt, like whiskey, like danger.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Mmff god, you ”</strong> I managed, before she bit my lower lip gently and pulled back with a smirk.

<span style="color: blue;">“You taste better than rum,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“What’s your name, boy?”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Caelan,”</strong> I gasped, shuddering as her cock ground against my thigh.

<span style="color: blue;">“Good. Say it again.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Caelan ”</strong>She kissed me harder.

<span style="color: blue;">“I’m Jessa. Remember that. You’ll be screaming it soon.”</span>

<span style="color: green;">“And I’m Nyla,”</span> the curvy one added as her hands reached for my belt. <span style="color: green;">“You’ll probably scream mine too.”</span>

My trousers hit the floor. I didn’t remember undoing them. Nyla had clever fingers, that was clear.

<span style="color: green;">“Gods, look at this cock,”</span> she moaned, wrapping her hand around me. <span style="color: green;">“Hard already, twitching like it missed us.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I did,”</strong> I admitted, dazed, body swaying from more than the sea. <strong style="color: purple;">“I fuck ”</strong>

Nyla’s mouth closed around my cock. Her tongue danced along the underside, swirling at the crown. Her lips slid down until her nose met my belly, and she moaned like she was drinking something divine. Jessa stepped behind me.

<span style="color: blue;">“Get him nice and ready,”</span> she said, voice hot in my ear. <span style="color: blue;">“He’s gonna take both of us.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">"Both.....?"</strong>My knees trembled.

<span style="color: green;">“I don’t think he’s ever had a cock in his ass before,”</span> Nyla teased between mouthfuls. <span style="color: green;">“He’s got that tight virgin look.”</span>

<span style="color: blue;">“Not for long,”</span> Jessa growled.

She spit on her hand, rubbed it along her cock, and then I felt her press against my rear. Firm. Demanding.

<span style="color: blue;">“Relax,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: blue;">“I’ll go slow.”</span> She didn’t. She pushed, steady but relentless, breaching me with a slow, delicious burn.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Aaaah fuck Jessa !”</strong> I cried out, every nerve alight.

<span style="color: blue;">“Say my name again,”</span> she groaned, inching deeper.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Jessa oh gods deeper ”</strong> Nyla sucked harder.

<span style="color: green;">“You’re such a good boy,”</span> she whispered, her hand stroking what her mouth couldn’t swallow. <span style="color: green;">“Taking her so well, cock in your ass, my mouth on yours. You’re gonna love it.”</span>

I did. I fucking loved it. Jessa was inside me fully now, hips grinding against my ass, and she leaned forward, chest against my back, lips at my ear.

<span style="color: blue;">“You feel perfect,”</span> she growled. <span style="color: blue;">“Hot and tight. Like you were made to get fucked like this.”</span> Nyla bobbed her head faster.

<span style="color: green;">“Don’t you dare cum yet,”</span> she warned, voice muffled but sharp.

<strong style="color: purple;">“I I’m close already ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“No,”</span> Jessa barked. <span style="color: blue;">“Not until we say so.”</span>

She started to thrust. Long, hard strokes. My body jolted with every one. The barrel creaked behind me. Nyla never let up, taking me to the base again and again, her hands now cupping my balls, kneading them like dough.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Fuuuck ”</strong> I cried, lost in it.

<span style="color: blue;">“Louder,”</span> Jessa hissed. <span style="color: blue;">“Scream for the storm.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“FUCK!”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“That’s more like it.”</span>

The ship rocked again. Jessa adjusted her angle and found something inside me that made stars explode behind my eyes.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Right there gods, do that again !”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“You’re gonna break,”</span> she grunted. <span style="color: blue;">“I can feel it.”</span> Nyla pulled back, spit trailing from her lips.

<span style="color: green;">“He’s leaking,”</span> she laughed. <span style="color: green;">“Look at that. He’s throbbing. So desperate. You want to cum, Caelan?”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Yes! Gods, yes!”</strong> She climbed up, straddling my thighs, her pussy pressed against my cock.

<span style="color: green;">“Not yet.”</span> She guided me inside her.

<span style="color: green;">“Now,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: green;">“Now we fuck.”</span>Her pussy was soaked.She rode me hard, breasts bouncing, sweat shining on her dark skin, her hands braced on my shoulders. Jessa never stopped moving behind me, their rhythm syncing into something primal.

<span style="color: green;">“You’re the best fuck I’ve ever had,”</span> Nyla moaned. <span style="color: green;">“So thick so fucking thick yes, just like that ”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Fuck, I’m ”</strong> I started, but Jessa slapped my ass.

<span style="color: blue;">“No. Hold it.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I can’t ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“You can. For us.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Please ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Say our names.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Nyla Jessa gods, I need ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“You’ll get it,”</span> Jessa snarled. <span style="color: blue;">“But not yet.”</span> Nyla ground her hips, her clit rubbing against my skin.

<span style="color: green;">“You’re gonna make me cum, Caelan don’t stop don’t you fucking stop ”</span> Her walls clenched. She screamed. Her whole body shuddered as she came, her juices spilling down my cock. She collapsed forward, kissing me breathless.

<span style="color: green;">“That’s for you,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: green;">“You made me gush, you beautiful bastard.”</span> Jessa rammed deep.

<span style="color: blue;">“Now you.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Please ”</strong>

<span style="color: blue;">“Cum for me.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">And I did.</strong>

My orgasm ripped through me like lightning through a mast. My cock pulsed inside Nyla, her cunt milking every drop. Jessa growled as I tightened around her, and she came too, filling me with heat, cock jerking deep inside. We collapsed in a pile. Panting. Spent. The ship rocked gently now. The storm hadn’t stopped. But the worst of it the wettest, loudest, neediest part was below deck.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_10/1.png">><</passage_img>>

A long corridor of shadowed marble stretched ahead, lit from nowhere, a haze of golden mist lacing the air like incense smoke. The walls were silent, reverent, and all down their length stood statues dozens of them, maybe hundreds. Each figure a woman: tall or small, cloaked or bare, carved in poses of supplication, dominion, grace, power. Some crowned, some hooded. Some weaponless, others bearing scepters, blades, spears. I couldn’t name them all, but I knew somehow who they were. Queens. Goddesses. Saints. Icons from some forgotten mythology that pulsed through my blood. They watched me, silent, unmoving. At first.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_10/2.png">><</passage_img>>

I walked. My footsteps echoed, each one a beat in some holy drum. The marble floor beneath me held no chill. I passed one statue, a woman kneeling, her hands clasped around a sword. Her lips were parted as if caught mid prayer. Her breasts, bared above a delicate bodice of stone lace, were flawless. My fingers brushed her cheek. And warmth bloomed. She blinked. Soft lashes lifted, and her eyes, grey as stormlight, looked directly into mine. Her lips moved.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_10/4.png">><</passage_img>>

<span style="color: red;">“You awaken us.”</span>

I startled, drew back. But she was already rising, joints creaking like bending ice. I stumbled back a step, breath caught, as her stone robe melted from her shoulders like falling ash. She was naked underneath. Pale, carved flesh transforming to living skin.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_10/3.png">><</passage_img>>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Wait, are you ”</strong>

But she didn’t answer. She walked past me like a queen descending to greet a soldier, lips parted in something between awe and hunger. She sank to her knees before me.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_10/5.png">><</passage_img>>

<span style="color: red;">“I have waited centuries,”</span> she murmured, voice a soft ache, <span style="color: red;">“to kneel at your altar.”</span> And then her mouth opened, her tongue running a slow circle around the head of my cock, which throbbed to hardness at the first touch.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Oh fuck ”</strong> I groaned, my hand bracing against the wall as her lips closed around me, warm and slow. Her stone made honey skin pressed against my thighs, arms looping around to cradle my ass, pulling me deeper into her throat. <strong style="color: purple;">“Fuck, you’re… You’re incredible…”</strong>

She didn’t speak again just swallowed around me, moaning softly as her eyes stayed fixed on mine. Behind her, more stone cracked. I looked up to see another figure stepping down. A taller one, her hair carved into braids that now flowed like living rivers over her shoulders. She wore a crown of iron roses, and a long cloak of ash and pearl that dissolved as she stepped forward. Queen Adina her name whispered itself into my brain like memory.

<span style="color: blue;">“You remember me,”</span> she said, smiling as she approached, hips swaying, one hand on the curve of her breast. <span style="color: blue;">“You kissed my statue once in the garden. When you were ten. Did you know we felt that?”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“I didn’t,”</strong> I whispered, watching her bare skin glow under invisible light.

<span style="color: blue;">“You do now.”</span> Her hands cupped my face, and she kissed me with centuries of need, her mouth tasting of wine and storm. Her body pressed to mine as the first woman still sucked my cock, slower now, languid, savoring each inch. Adina moaned into my mouth.

<span style="color: blue;">“We all waited for you.”</span> She pulled back and looked down.

<span style="color: blue;">“Share,”</span> she said softly, and the kneeling woman pulled away with a kiss to the tip and a shimmer of spit stretching between her lips and my cock. Adina knelt next, regal, composed, yet trembling with eagerness. <span style="color: blue;">“You’ll bless us all,”</span> she whispered, before taking me into her mouth, tongue swirling. Her technique was practiced, deliberate she didn’t bob her head like the first. She worshiped.

I was trembling.Another sound behind. A soft moan, and the grinding creak of movement. I turned. And saw her.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_10/6.png">><</passage_img>>

She lay reclined on a marble dais, limbs splayed, one hand cupping a heavy, full breast, the other resting between her thighs. But her thighs bore more than one surprise. A cock rose stiff from her pelvis thick, veined, flushed dark with arousal. And below that, glistening lips opened in a wet invitation. Her voice cracked the ceiling.

<span style="color: green;">“You worship us,”</span> she thundered, but her tone was silk. <span style="color: green;">“Now let us worship you.”</span>She sat up. <span style="color: green;">“Do you like what you see?”</span>

I was silent, my cock throbbing between Adina’s lips.

<strong style="color: purple;">“Yes,”</strong> I said. <strong style="color: purple;">“Yes, I gods, I love it.”</strong>

<span style="color: green;">“You want to taste me?”</span>

I nodded. Her laugh was low. <span style="color: green;">“Then come, supplicant.”</span>

I walked to her, my cock glistening with spit, Adina panting behind me, now stroking herself where she’d bent over. I knelt between the goddess’s legs. I kissed her cock first. It twitched against my lips.

<span style="color: green;">“You’re not shy,”</span> she purred.

<strong style="color: purple;">“No.”</strong> I took her into my mouth.

She let out a sharp, rich, <span style="color: green;">“Aahhh yes, that’s it just like that, suck your goddess, you beautiful mortal thing ”</span>

My tongue traced the ridge, lips stretched wide, my hand stroking her as I sucked, and her thighs trembled. Her pussy, right below, wept open. My fingers slid down, two slipping inside her. She gasped.

<span style="color: green;">“Yes yes touch both ”</span>

I licked down her shaft and pressed my mouth to her cunt, tongue flicking, then flattening. She rocked her hips, pressing into me.

<span style="color: green;">“Such a hungry little tongue,”</span> she growled, claws combing through my hair. <span style="color: green;">“Lick your goddess until she breaks ”</span> Behind me, soft steps.

<span style="color: red;">“I want a turn,”</span> said a new voice. Low, lush, regal again.

<<passage_img "dream/dream_10/7.png">><</passage_img>>

I turned and saw her another figure, slim, dark skinned, draped in nothing but silken chains that clinked with every breath. Her eyes were black pools. She knelt beside the goddess.

<span style="color: red;">“You’ll share,”</span> she said.

<span style="color: green;">“Of course,”</span> the goddess replied. <span style="color: green;">“He’s ours now.”</span>

I found myself pulled up, the goddess’s cock against my belly as the chained queen straddled my thighs.

<span style="color: red;">“I want you to fuck me while she watches.”</span>

I didn’t speak I just pulled her down. Her heat swallowed me whole.

<span style="color: red;">“Mmh ah fuck,”</span> she moaned, riding me with slow, rolling thrusts. <span style="color: red;">“Feel that? I’ve waited so long to have you fill me ”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“Gods, you feel so good ”</strong> Her chains jingled with every thrust, every slap of our bodies. The goddess behind her stroked herself slowly, watching.

<span style="color: green;">“Breed her,”</span> she whispered. <span style="color: green;">“Fill her up for us.”</span>

<strong style="color: purple;">“You’re tight fuck fuck harder ”</strong>

<span style="color: red;">“Harder, yes, gods, more yes, make me take it ”</span>

We moved in a rhythm older than time, and more statues came to life. By the dozen. They stepped down, some watching, some touching themselves, others forming lines. One leaned close, licking my nipple as I thrust. Another knelt to tongue my balls. One sat beside the chained queen and kissed her as we fucked. It was a temple of heat, of flesh, of moans echoing like music.

<span style="color: greygreen;">“Please, I want him next ”</span>

<span style="color: grey;">“He belongs to us all ”</span>

<span style="color: magenta;">"Let me ride him, I need to ”</span>

<span style="color: orange;">“Make me feel like that, I’m begging you ”</span>

<span style="color: darkred;">“I want his tongue I want his cock I want his cum ”</span>

I was lost in it. Hands, mouths, tongues. They passed me between them like a chalice. I fucked the goddess. I fucked the queen. I fucked a priestess with wings carved into her back and watched them twitch with every thrust. One wept when I filled her, sobbing joy against my chest. Another took me from behind while two kissed her breasts, whispering praise.

<span style="color: greygreen;">“My king, my god, my light ”</span>

I fucked one girl on her knees while her sister rode my face. I licked a virgin's cunt while she cried out, <strong style="color: purple;">“You make me burn gods, you’re making me ahh !”</strong> and clutched at the statues nearby. I came inside them. Over them. Between them. Every orgasm only drew more from me. They couldn’t get enough.

<span style="color: grey;">“I want your seed I want your blessing ”</span>

<span style="color: magenta;">“You’re divine you’re ours you’re the flame ”</span> They weren’t human. Or they were, once. But now they were myth. Flesh made worship. Holiness made lust.

<span style="color: orange;">“Your tongue, please yes oh gods, right there don’t stop ”</span>

I buried my face in her, licking until her legs shook and she collapsed gasping. Another dragged me up into a kiss, cunt grinding against mine, our cocks pressed together as she stroked both. <strong style="color: purple;">“I want to feel you shoot while I do fuck yes stroke us both, just like that ”</strong> Cum sprayed her belly, mine mixing with hers.

She smeared it over her breasts, panting. <span style="color: darkred;">“Anointed. Gods, I love you.”</span> They praised me as I moved from one to the next. More than thosand voices. And more words than I could count.
