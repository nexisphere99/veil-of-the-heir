A grotesquely beautiful creature born of illusion and lust magic, the Shadebound Changeling is 
genderless but takes on hyper-sensualized forms—twisting itself into whatever its target fears or desires most. 
It feeds on identity, lust, and shame. It mimics others and uses mirroring magic to psychologically dominate its prey. 
It speaks in a voice that shifts between sultry and cruel.
