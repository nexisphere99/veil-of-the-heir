Prince Caelan investigates a decaying chapel at dusk, long abandoned after the Sacred Uprising. 
Strange whispers and cold wind lead him to the altar, where a lone figure in tattered robes stands 
beneath a cracked stained glass window. His presence feels... wrong. He does not breathe.

<<speech "caelen">>I know you’re there. The villagers heard chanting. You're not welcome here.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>Mmm… such a voice. Not quite falsetto. Not quite baritone. A song trapped between verses. How... exquisite.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "caelen">>I didn’t come for riddles. Speak your name.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>I was Serathis. Now I am... Hollow. I speak with the breath of the void and listen with ears full of echoes. And you—what are you, little one?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>No, no. That name lies. You are no prince now.<br>I see breasts beneath that royal leather. I smell sacred oils in your hair. The Queen’s spell is strong… and you are bending to it.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "caelen">>I bend to no one.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>Ah, but you do. Your waist narrows with submission. Your hips bloom with obedience. Your walk whispers secrets you haven’t yet said aloud.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "caelen">>Then read my sword.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>Oh, but why would I harm a holy thing? You are becoming divine. Your flesh remembers what your mind fears to admit.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "caelen">>You’ll pay for that.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>Mmm. Wrath suits you. Rage is still a prince’s gift. But your anger now… it rises like perfume, not fire. It dances.<</speech>><br>

<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>You’d spill blood with such dainty hands?<br>Those are queen’s hands now… made to hold silk, not swords.<</speech>><br>

Caelan stumbles back, arms shaking. His sword is slick with blood, 
but Serathis is still standing, dark magic dancing in the air around him. 
The chapel pulses with whispers. Caelan’s head spins.
<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>You’re faltering, fledgling. The spell twists in your bones. 
Your hips betray you—unbalanced. 
Your grip? Weak from dainty fingers not meant for war.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "caelen">>You… haven’t… won…<</speech>><br>
<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>But I’ve seen you now. The prince is gone. 
The boy—buried beneath perfume and corsets. Only doubt remains.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "caelen">>Shut up!<</speech>><br>
<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>Run, pretty thing. Flee in silk and shame. 
Return to your Queen and tell her you’re not ready. Not yet.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "caelen">>Next time… you’ll choke on my name.<</speech>><br>
He hurls the charm. It flashes — a blinding golden light. 
Serathis recoils with a hiss. Caelan dashes out, blood running from his arm, vision blurred.
<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>Run, lovely little ghost. But the transformation never stops. 
Even in defeat, your body becomes softer... sweeter…<</speech>><br>
<<speech "caelen">>I’ll return. With better footing. A sharper edge. 
Let him mock my curves—next time, I’ll carve his name into the stone.<</speech>><br>

Serathis is on his knees, robes torn, his eyes flickering like dying stars. 
Caelan stands over him, hair wild, blade slick with dark ichor. 
The chapel shakes with residual magic.<br>

<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>I… see it now. You’re not just becoming… you’re transcending.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "caelen">>Transcend somewhere else.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>Your body hums… a melody of flesh unmoored. 
You are sacred ruin. I wanted to… taste it…<</speech>><br>
<<speech "caelen">>You’ve done enough.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "serathis" $hollow_acolyte_img>>I was supposed to unmake you…<</speech>><br>
<<speech "caelen">>But you reminded me what I’ve become. I’m not a half-prince. 
Not a lost boy. I’m something new. Something powerful.<</speech>><br>
<<speech "caelen">>They keep thinking my softness makes me weak. But softness endures.<</speech>><br>
