The steam greeted me like an embrace I didn’t ask for. My thighs ached. My shoulders were raw where the armor had chafed. And beneath it all the lace was still clinging to me, soaked, sticky, and sinfully snug.
I’d trained for hours under Sir Aldric, dressed not just in armor but in Veletia’s lace. Stockings, garters, open-backed panties, and that trembling, taunting bra all hidden beneath leather and steel. A secret swaddling me tight.
And now it clung to my skin like a second layer of flesh.
I stepped into the private chamber of the royal bathhouse, and the world melted away. Candles flickered in carved alcoves. White steam curled off the surface of the water, misting the marble like a silken veil.
No servants. No guards.
I stripped off my armor slowly, each buckle whispering as it loosened. My pauldrons dropped with a dull thunk. My cuirass slid off with a groan of worn leather. Greaves, boots, gauntlets until I was standing in just that fragile web of lingerie.
Sweat had soaked the lace. The bra was darkened at the edges, cups heavy and damp, nipples stiff beneath. The panties clung to my slit yes, slit, I had to call it that now like a second tongue, warm and velvet-soft from hours of motion and tension. My pubic mound throbbed with every shift of weight.
The stockings were rolled slightly down at the tops, where the garter clasps had pulled during training. Everything itched, pressed, shifted.
And I couldn’t look away.
I stood before the bath’s polished bronze mirror and saw myself: half-feminine, half-armored, glistening with sweat and shame and something I still wouldn’t name.
My breasts had swelled slightly more. The bra cradled them now barely. They overflowed the lace like soft fruit pressing through netting. The garter belt was crooked, twisted from the fight.
I looked like a boy dressed in his mother’s secrets.
And I hated how much I felt.
I reached behind and unclasped the bra.
It peeled away with a wet kiss, the lace catching momentarily on my hard nipples before releasing. They bounced slightly in the cool air red, tender, aching.
My breath hitched.
Then the panties. I hooked my thumbs into the damp waistband and pulled down. They clung sticking to my inner thighs where sweat and arousal had mingled. They peeled away like skin. My slit glistened. I bit my lip and stepped out of them.
The stockings and garters followed, each strip of cloth reminding me just how far I’d gone.
And how little I had left that was mine.
I slipped into the bath.
The water stung.
My nipples went hard immediately. My breasts floated slightly, the new weight pulling gently at my chest as I leaned back. The heat slid between my thighs and touched places no blade ever had.
I closed my eyes.
My hands floated beside me. I didn’t touch myself. I didn’t need to.
The memory of it all pressed in Veletia’s fingers guiding lace up my thighs, Aldric’s voice low in my ear, the strap slipping from my shoulder mid-swing.
I remembered how the panties had grown wet before I was ready to admit why. How the bra’s pressure had felt like a lover’s hand.
I shifted in the water and gasped.
The heat flowed into me now inside me. I was open. Not visibly, not yet, but the magic had begun. And hot water found the cracks in my flesh, in my mind.
I bit my lip.&lt;br>&lt;br>
<<speech "Caelen">>Don’t.<<speech>><br>
But I arched.
My breasts bobbed above the surface, nipples breaching the water like periscopes pink, aching. My thighs trembled. A single droplet slipped down from my navel and vanished between them.
I reached for the folded lingerie at the pool’s edge.
It looked obscene now, drenched and fragile, half-transparent. The lace sagged. The cups had molded to my breast shape. The panties retained the curve of my slit, even empty.
I brought the bra to my lips and pressed my mouth to the soaked lace.&lt;br>&lt;br>
Why?
I didn’t know. Maybe to taste what I’d become.
The fabric smelled of sweat and perfume and something faintly musky me.
My throat tightened.&lt;br>&lt;br>
It wasn’t arousal. Not really. It was need.
Need to understand.
To feel something mine in the transformation.
The door creaked behind me.&lt;br>&lt;br>
I froze, chest heaving, water sloshing gently around my breasts.&lt;br>&lt;br>
<<speech "Maera">>Caelan?<<speech>><br>
I panicked. I grabbed for the towel, clutching it to my chest, covering the visible curve of breasts still floating defiantly above the water.&lt;br>&lt;br>
<<speech "Maera">>Sorry I didn’t know you were here already.<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Caelen">>I don’t look.<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Maera">>Oh.<<speech>><br>
She said, but didn’t turn. Her gaze dropped, lips parting slightly.&lt;br>&lt;br>
<<speech "Maera">>You’re really… changing.<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Caelen">>Get out.<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Maera">>I brought clean clothes. Mistress Veletia sent them.<<speech>><br>
I blushed.&lt;br>&lt;br>
<<speech "Caelen">>What kind of clothes?<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Maera">>What do you think?<<speech>><br>
I looked at the towel in my lap. My nipples had stiffened beneath it. I crossed my arms.&lt;br>&lt;br>
<<speech "Caelen">>I’m not doing this for pleasure.<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Maera">>I never said you were.<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Caelen">>Then why are you staring?<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Maera">>Because you’re beautiful.<<speech>><br>
I hated the way my stomach fluttered.&lt;br>&lt;br>
She reached into the bundle and pulled out new lingerie.
Lilac again. This time, even finer. Sheer. A matching set bra, panties, garter belt, thigh-highs with embroidered tops.&lt;br>&lt;br>
<<speech "Caelen">>I’m not wearing that.<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Maera">>You wore the last set.<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Caelen">>I was under armor.<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Maera">>And now?<<speech>><br>
I looked down at myself. At my breasts, my thighs, the smooth new cleft between my legs. My skin gleamed in the water like it had been buffed with oil.&lt;br>&lt;br>
<<speech "Caelen">>I’m still me.<<speech>><br>
<<speech "Maera">>Then prove it.<<speech>><br>
She said, placing the lingerie on the bath’s edge.
She left, silent as shadow.
I stared at the lace.
It looked even more obscene now than before.
But I rose from the water.
Steam rolled off my body. My breasts quivered, droplets gathering at the tips. My thighs parted slightly as I stepped out. I picked up the panties.&lt;br>&lt;br>
Still warm.&lt;br>&lt;br>
Still damp.&lt;br>&lt;br>
I stepped into them slowly, lifting one leg, then the other. The fabric rose, settling perfectly over my slit, holding me like memory.&lt;br>&lt;br>
Then the bra. I struggled to fasten it. My breasts resisted, still damp, still heavy. I pulled them into place, adjusted the cups.&lt;br>&lt;br>
I looked in the mirror.&lt;br>&lt;br>
And didn’t flinch.
The lingerie clung like destiny.
