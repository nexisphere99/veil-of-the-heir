Oh, you poor thing those sleeves are a tragedy, and that posture? Criminal. Come in, darling, I’m about to rescue your future.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
Can I at least breathe while I’m being saved?
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Only if you're planning to exhale confidence. Now off with the dull, on with the divine!
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 1>>
<<speech "veletia">>
Did you bring that tunic from the battlefield or the broom closet? Because either way, it’s not meeting royalty today.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
It’s comfortable. Is that such a crime?
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Comfort is for bedchambers, darling. Out here, we command with fabric.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 2>>
<<speech "veletia">>
Today, we drape you in midnight blue. Sensual, mysterious, devastating. Like a rumor in silk.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
I was aiming for ‘competent ruler,’ but sure let’s start with ‘rumor in silk.’
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Oh, but a ruler who turns heads rules twice. Trust me.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 3>>
<<speech "veletia">>
Lift your chin, relax your fingers, walk like the world owes you a bow. That’s how queens move.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
Feels more like acting than walking.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Every great performance begins on a stage. Eventually, it becomes who you are.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 4>>
<<speech "veletia">>
This fabric was stitched with moonlight, darling. One twirl and you’ll outshine prophecy itself.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
Do I get a sword with that or just stares?
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Why not both? Slay with style, I always say.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 5>>
<<speech "veletia">>
Try this corset. It teaches posture, mystery, and patience all in one wicked squeeze.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
I think it just taught me regret.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Pain is temporary. Beauty? Oh, that’s remembered in paintings.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 6>>
<<speech "veletia">>
There’s power in a perfect fit. Threads that embrace instead of armor that hides.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
And what if I’m still figuring out who I am beneath all these threads?
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Then let the fabric show you. Sometimes silk knows before the soul does.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 7>>
<<speech "veletia">>
That sway of your hips was accidental, wasn’t it? Good. It means your body is listening to me.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
Or protesting in confusion. Hard to tell with hips.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Confusion is just transformation in motion. You’re on the right path, my dear.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 8>>
<<speech "veletia">>
I dreamed of you last night in emerald, draped in defiance, with a crown of fire. It was divine.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
Sounds dramatic. Do I survive the dream?
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Oh yes. But only after making half the court swoon and the other half burn with envy.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 9>>
<<speech "veletia">>
One last touch… there. Now you’re no longer just a royal you’re a vision.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
I’m not sure I recognize myself.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Good. That means we’ve found something new. Something extraordinary.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 10>>
<<speech "veletia">>
Darling, if eyes don’t follow you across the ballroom like sunflowers chasing light, then I’ve failed you utterly.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
I was hoping for grace, not gawking.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Grace is the art of commanding a gaze without ever begging for it. You’re learning.
<</speech>>
<br>


<<elseif _i == 11>>
<<speech "veletia">>
Mmm, this silk clings like a lover's promise. Tell me, Caelan, are you brave enough to wear temptation itself?
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
Only if it doesn't whisper too loudly in council meetings.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Oh, it will whisper. But that’s half the fun power dressed as poetry.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 12>>
<<speech "veletia">>
I see the curve of your shoulders softening beautiful, like dusk melting into night.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
You make it sound like I’m vanishing.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
No, darling. You're becoming inevitable.
<</speech>>
<br>


<<elseif _i == 13>>
<<speech "veletia">>
Step, turn, pause your hips are beginning to sing. Now let’s teach them the whole aria.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
I swear these heels are a form of warfare.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Exactly. And you, my dear, are learning to conquer in silence and satin.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 14>>
<<speech "veletia">>
Oh, Caelan… in this gown, you don’t enter a room you rewrite it.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
And yet I still feel like I’m playing dress up.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Then play it beautifully, until the mirror stops laughing and starts applauding.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 15>>
<<speech "veletia">>
Tell me, sweetling does it thrill you a little, knowing how dangerous you’ll look in velvet and pearl?
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
Dangerous or ridiculous? I'm never quite sure with you.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Then you're standing at the perfect edge. Now lean into it.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 16>>
<<speech "veletia">>
A soft touch here, a cinch there oh, if only diplomacy were as easy as corsetry.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
At least corsets don’t lie to your face.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
They do, darling. They just lie charmingly.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 17>>
<<speech "veletia">>
Let them whisper, let them stare because the future queen walks on whispers and drowns them in presence.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
You make scandal sound like a royal accessory.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
It is, dear. The crown is heavy but the drama? That’s where the sparkle lives.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 18>>
<<speech "veletia">>
A little lace at the wrist, a slit in the right place… balance, my dear, is everything.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
This balance feels like standing on a dagger’s point.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Exactly! Now smile like you enjoy the edge.
<</speech>>
<br>
<<elseif _i == 19>>
<<speech "veletia">>
When I’m done with you, even the gods will look twice and wonder whose side you’re on.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "mc">>
Hopefully mine. I could use the divine backup.
<</speech>>
<br>

<<speech "veletia">>
Oh no, darling. You will be the divine backup.

Veletia’s atelier smelled faintly of lavender oil and warm velvet. 
The curtains were always half drawn, spilling pink dusk light across silk bolts and embroidery hoops, 
mannequins dressed in every imagined shade of femininity, lined up like ladies in waiting caught mid curtsy. <br><br>
Her chambers felt like a forbidden room in a storybook a place I never imagined myself stepping foot in, and yet, here I was.
My new body felt strange beneath my cloth. Not in pain, no, not even unfamiliar anymore. 
Just... tense. My center was soft now, foreign and damp with nervous sweat. <br><br>
I walked differently, my thighs brushed in ways they never had. 
Everything pulled downward when I moved, reminding me I was bare underneath. Vulnerable. Changed.
And she noticed, of course.<br><br>

<<speech "veletia">>To see how silk clings to soft, bare femininity. Now, disrobe for me, darling. Everything.<</speech>><br>

<<speech   "mc">>E everything?<</speech>><br>

<<speech "veletia">>You don’t expect me to measure hips and cheeks and sacred folds through royal armor, do you?<</speech>><br>

I hesitated, then began to undress. My cheeks flushed as cool air kissed new, tender skin.<br><br>

<<speech "veletia">>You’ll find women warm in all the right places. There. 34 inches… for now.<</speech>><br>

I stayed silent, the knot in my throat catching against the simple truth of her logic. 
The robe slipped from my shoulders and pooled at my feet, leaving me standing naked in the golden light.<br><br>
She turned, holding a pale pink pair of panties so fine I could see the silhouette of her fingers through the silk. 
Her gaze trailed from my face down to my navel, then between my thighs. Something flickered there curiosity, approval, a hint of something darker.<br><br>
<<speech "veletia">>Well, they’ve done a lovely job.<</speech>><br>
My cheeks burned. I crossed my arms over my chest, such as it was. 
Breasts had begun to form, soft buds beneath skin that felt too tight over aching tissue. 
Not much yet, but enough to jiggle when I walked.<br><br>

I tried not to flinch when she knelt beside me.<br><br>
<<speech "veletia">>Widen your stance. A bit more. Yes. We’ll need to accommodate your new softness here<</speech>><br>

She stood, placing the tape around my chest, under my arms.<br><br>
<<speech "veletia">>Breasts... do things to balance. 
And underwear, proper underwear, will either teach you grace or expose your every secret.<</speech>><br>
I felt her fingers graze beneath the budding swell of my breasts.

Her voice lowered as she circled behind me.<br><br>
<<speech "veletia">>And maybe just maybe someone you haven’t met yet. Or someone who already watches.<</speech>><br>

Her touch released, and I exhaled shakily. 
She moved back to her drawer and pulled out three sets of underwear. 
One simple cotton, one lace trimmed, one... translucent. Gossamer thin and pink, like spun candy. I looked at them.<br><br>

She held the pink pair out toward me. I stared at it. The fabric fluttered, impossibly light. My fingers moved before I could stop them, and I took it.<br><br>
<<speech "veletia">>Put it on.<</speech>><br>
My heart thudded. I stepped into them awkwardly, pulling them up my thighs. 
The material clung immediately, drawing snug across the curve of my pelvis. My breath caught.<br><br>
It was... soft. Frighteningly soft. It caressed places I’d never known I had. 
My mound yes, that’s what it was now pressed gently against the silk, encased, cupped, and hidden.<br><br>
Every step I took sent the material whispering over skin, and I shivered.<br><br>

It rattled the glass panes in their leaded frames as I stepped back into Veletia’s atelier, robe clutched tight, the memory of silk still haunting my hips. 
I hadn’t meant to return so soon. I hadn’t planned anything at all, really.<br><br>
But my chest hurt.
It had started as a mild pressure an ache that throbbed beneath the skin whenever I bent too quickly, whenever the robe brushed too hard. 
But it wasn’t just soreness now. It was weight. <br><br>
Shape. Something pulling forward, tugging at the skin around my ribs. Softness I hadn’t owned a week ago.
The potion’s work was becoming real.
And I needed something to hold it in place.
I was not here for pleasure.<br><br>
Still, my body betrayed me, flushing under my robe like it remembered the last visit. I absorb the rising heat and knocked.
The door opened before I touched it twice.
Mistress Veletia stood barefoot on the silken floor, hair pinned up in a cascade of silver and plum. She looked surprised but only for a breath.<br><br>

I had told myself I wouldn’t return.
But the silk had done something to me.
Every night since I wore it, I’d caught myself touching. Not with lust. Not always. 
Sometimes just to feel the material where it pressed into the crease between my thighs, to confirm it was real, that I was real, and no longer the body I’d known. 
The panties made me aware of friction, of heat, of motion.
And the absence of them the next day had felt worse.
Now I stood again outside Veletia’s atelier, heart pounding, robe loose, thighs bare underneath. I didn’t knock. I stepped in.
She was arranging corsets when I entered some long boned, others short waisted, laced up the back like secrets.<br><br>

She walked past me, brushing my shoulder. I caught her scent spiced rose and warm fabric. 
She went to a cabinet I hadn’t seen before, low and locked, gilded with tiny carvings.<br><br>
When she opened it, I saw them.
Not just underthings art.
Bras so light they looked like spiderwebs spun from moonlight. Panties that shimmered when the air moved. 
Stockings so sheer they disappeared against the mannequin legs. Garter belts with jeweled clasps.<br><br>
<<speech "veletia">>This is your next step. check these my princess..<</speech>><br>
It was lilac. The bra was demi cut, trimmed in lace so fine it looked dusted on. 
The panties were open at the back slits curved around the buttocks, framed with embroidery. 
The garter belt had small silver flowers dangling from the clips.<br><br>

As they rose up my thighs, the lace grazed my skin like fingers.<br><br>

They didn’t cover me. Not fully. The slit at the back left me exposed. My new mound pressed against the front cupped and outlined.<br><br>
<<speech "veletia">>Delicious.<</speech>><br>
Next, the bra. She guided the cups over my forming breasts, her fingers warm, placing them inside the lace like a gardener handling fresh petals.<br><br>

Then the garter belt. She wrapped it around my waist, clasping it snug.

The dangling clips tickled my thighs.<br><br>

<<speech "veletia">>Stockings.<</speech>><br>

She stepped back not rejection, but offering space, like a queen stepping aside so a crown might descend. 
Her movements were liquid silk as she crossed the atelier to a set of heavy curtains. 
I hadn’t noticed them before not truly. They’d blended in like stage wings, unremarkable until summoned. She drew them back.<br><br>

Behind them was another room vaster, lit silver rather than gold. Candles glowed in sconces. 
Mirrors lined the walls in irregular angles, each reflecting a broken shard of whoever entered. 
Mannequins stood here too, but like sentinels, not decoration - 
armored corsets, gowns that whispered of royalty and ruin, heels shaped like weapons. 
Gloves, chokers, thigh chains, velvet capes, boleros edged in fur or thread like dried blood. And in the center, a dais. Not a throne. An arena.<br><br>

The lingerie clung, amplified, displayed.<br><br>

<<speech "veletia">>You’re not a finished silhouette. You’re a sketch still smudging into being. 
Perfect. The Queensguard needs in-betweens. Not man. Not woman. Not knight.

She turned to the mannequins again and lifted something darker, more dangerous: 
a corset. Long, black, lined with violet. Trimmed with what looked like silver boning.

<<speech "veletia">>Now go. Rest. Drink something sweet. And tomorrow… be mine.<</speech>><br>

I turned toward the atelier door. My limbs tingled. 
The lingerie clung to me now not like a costume, but a second skin or maybe a first skin finally exposed.
As I reached the threshold, her voice came again, light and wicked:<br><br>

<<speech "veletia">>Oh, and next time?<</speech>><br>

I looked back. She lifted a heavy black velvet choker from a mannequin and held it between two fingers like a challenge.<br><br>

The dressing bloom was not a room.
It was a trap.
Circular, domed in glass and veiled in hanging petals of rose colored silk, 
it smelled like powdered lilies and something thicker like heat trapped in lace. 
Daylight filtered through stained glass panels high above, casting honeyed light across fainting lounges, 
racks of dresses, and drawers that never quite stayed closed.
And in the middle of it all: Veletia’s throne, though she called it a fitting chair.
I stood at the threshold, barely over the tiled inlay that marked the entrance, fists clenched at my sides. 
The clothes I wore were old my own, at least formerly. Trousers that no longer sat right on my hips, 
a tunic that pulled tight across a chest that shouldn’t exist, and boots that slipped every time 
I walked because my ankles were now smaller, more delicate somehow.

Reluctantly, I stepped forward. My hands reached out.
The fabric brushed my fingers. It was cool. But also warm, like a lover’s breath trapped in linen. It slid like mist.

I moved stiffly behind it.
And then I stopped.

I kicked them off, hating the way they bunched beneath my new hips. My thighs, no longer flat or firm, were soft, 
brushing together in a way that always left me damp. The panties beneath were still Veletia’s. Whisper-thin. Clinging.
I couldn’t take them off.
Instead, I slipped the new tunic hers over my head.
It fit.
I froze.
It draped along my waist like it had been born on me. The collar framed my neck in a way that made my throat feel long. 
The fabric brushed my chest gently, caressing the sensitive skin of my budding breasts. The sleeves hugged my arms just enough to whisper, you are smaller now. More precious. Breakable.
It was too much.

<<speech "veletia">>Does it feel wrong, Caelan, or does it feel too right?<</speech>><br>
I said nothing. Couldn’t. The fabric clung too close to my thoughts.
The dress was soft deceptively so. A pale lilac bodice, tight but not rigid, drawn in just beneath the chest to hint at something rising. 
The skirt flowed from the waist in a hush of silk, parting at the sides to reveal a thinner gauze layer beneath. Not sheer, but close. A breeze would make it scandal.
And I was wearing it.<br><br>
It hugged me like it knew my name better than I did.
Veletia watched me squirm in front of the mirror, one hip cocked slightly from how the skirts dragged. My legs kept brushing together, bare beneath the hem.<br><br>

No doors led to it. No servants entered. It was a secret chamber of silk and shadow, perfumed with things meant to unmake pretense. Drapes hung from the ceiling like veils of fog.

I shouldn’t have followed her in.

I looked down at myself pink panties pulled aside, the outline of my folds still trembling,
 the dress bunched around my hips, and lace brushing every place I was now most sensitive.
I whispered,<br><br>

Veletia tilted her head.<br><br>

The floor of Veletia’s dressing bloom was colder than I remembered.
Maybe it was the absence of carpet beneath my feet bare, except for the thin stockings I now wore out of habit. 
They clung snugly to my calves, sheer but functional. Silk again, of course. Everything here was silk.
And I told myself this would be the last time.<br><br>

I folded my arms, waiting. Determined not to sit, not to linger. 
I’d come in wearing one of her fitted tunics again, 
long enough to cover the tops of my thighs. 
Still, the sensation of the hem grazing against silk panties when 
I walked reminded me insistently that no part of me belonged to a man’s wardrobe anymore.<br><br>
<<passage_img "cloths/shoes/shoe_2/1.png">><</passage_img>>
She returned a moment later, holding a pair of boots.
They were soft black leather, polished to a quiet shine. 
Mid-calf height. No heel, just a solid sole with the faintest taper at the toe. 
Practical… but the shape was wrong. Too slim. Too sleek. Too curved.<br><br>
 <<speech "mc">>These are women’s boots,<</speech>><br>

 <<speech "veletia">>Would you rather I kneel and dress you standing?<</speech>><br>
I sat. Quickly.
Her smirk deepened, but she said nothing.
She knelt in front of me, calm and steady, and set the boots down beside my feet. 
Her fingers slid around my ankle soft, firm pressure and guided my foot into the first boot. It slid in easily.
Too easily.<br><br>

I looked down at the boots.
They really did fit perfectly. Light against my calves. 
Firm across my arches. When I flexed my feet, the leather hugged like a second skin. 
They made no sound when I stood silent tread, feminine balance. Soft steps.<br><br>
 <<speech "veletia">>They’ll take time to wear in,<</speech>><br>
She said behind me.<br><br>

The boots made no sound.<br>
That was the first betrayal.<br>
They moved with me not against.<br>
Not clunky, not too big. Not boots for hunting, not boots for ceremony. Just… soft, knowing things.<br>
They hugged my calves snugly under the hem of my tunic, warming more with every step.<br>
Every subtle sway of my hips shifted the leather slightly, and I felt it always.<br><br>
It should’ve felt like armor.<br>
Instead, it felt like I’d grown new limbs.<br><br>
Veletia hadn’t followed. She didn’t need to. She’d won something the moment I didn’t take the boots off after leaving her chambers.<br>
Not just the boots. She’d stood behind me in the mirror, hands sliding down my thighs as she cinched the tunic’s waist tighter, whispering:<br>
“You feel that curve? That sway in your walk? It’s always been there. I’ve just uncovered it.”<br><br>
Now I walked the eastern corridor back toward my rooms alone. Or so I thought.<br><br>
I should’ve heard them first. I should’ve turned around, or taken the servants’ stair, or waited until night.<br><br>
But then<br><br>
<<speech "alinora">>Caelan.<</speech>><br><br>
My mother’s voice. Crisp. Cool. Queen Alinora did not call people by name unless it was a warning.<br>
I turned.<br><br>
She stood halfway down the corridor, flanked by my father the king-consort and Lady Gisela, her favorite niece.<br>
They were mid-conversation, and I had walked directly into their line of sight.<br><br>
Alinora’s gaze swept me. Not harsh. Assessing. I wore a fitted gray tunic over pale stockings.<br>
Feminine in cut, long enough to be decent, short enough to be unmistakable. The boots peeked out from under the hem.<br>
Her eyes dropped to them. She blinked.<br><br>
Therion was slower to react. He was tall, silver-haired, tired. His expression always hovered somewhere between melancholy and polite confusion.<br>
Gisela, on the other hand beautiful and venomous smirked outright.<br><br>

My gait had changed. Less rigid. My center shifted forward now when I walked.<br>

My face burned. I shoved past her and didn’t look back.
I made it to my chambers without incident.
Closed the door.
Locked it.
And then collapsed onto the chaise at the foot of my bed, heart pounding.<br><br>
The boots still felt perfect.
Too perfect.
I reached down to pull them off.
And stopped.
My fingers brushed the top of one. Leather. Warm now, shaped to me. 
I slid my hand lower, felt the snugness at my calf. The silk of my stocking clung inside, slick where sweat had gathered.
My legs were trembling.<br><br>
Not with fear.
With something else.
I pressed my thighs together.
The boots squeezed gently just a little reminder that they were made for this form.
For me.
And under the tunic, I could feel it again flesh reshaped, smaller, softer, curved now into something the fabric coaxed and hid at once.
I didn’t take them off.
Not yet.<br><br>
